    <strong>APPALACHIAN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT&nbsp;</strong>(ASD)&rsquo;s mission is to transition Appalachia to a
    more resilient economy and a healthier population by supporting local agriculture, exploring new economic
    opportunities and connecting people to healthy food.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>APPALACHIAN HARVEST</strong>&nbsp;is ASD&rsquo;s rural food hub that first opened its doors in 2000.
    Following the Federal deregulation of tobacco production, many growers found their incomes reduced and they were
    looking for alternative crops to capitalize on their experience and existing resources. &nbsp;Appalachian Harvest
    helped local farmers stay on family farms by transitioning them to growing produce.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>APPALACHIAN HARVEST</strong>&nbsp;works with farms in Central Appalachia, including these Virginia farms:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Pendleton Farms</em>&nbsp;is a 4th generation family farm. They currently operate a 200 acre farm in Jonesville,
    VA where they run 50 head of registered Simmental cattle and about 5 acres of organic produce. &nbsp;The crops they
    currently grow include peppers, squash, zucchini, and heirloom tomatoes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R &amp; L Farms</em>&nbsp;has operated a 10 acre farm located in Scott County, Virginia since 2014. They grow
    organic squash with the hopes of expanding production into other crops in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Lyons Family Farm&nbsp;</em>is a 600 acre farm operation located in Tazewell County, VA. They run about 75
    balancer momma cows and put up several acres in hay. Along with the cattle they also grow around 40 acres of
