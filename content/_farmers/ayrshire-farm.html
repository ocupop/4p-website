    Ayrshire Farms takes great pride in their ability to combine the old with the new. They like to say they have one
    foot in the 19th century while one foot also firmly planted in the 21st century. Originally a plantation from the
    1820&rsquo;s, the farm works hard to preserve it&rsquo;s rich history while also joining forces with the modern
    world to address many contemporary issues. One aspect of Ayrshire&rsquo;s modernity is its commitment to humane,
    organic, and sustainable farming practices. Some of the official certifications they proudly sport are Certified
    Organic, Certified Humane, Project Non-GMO Verified, Food Alliance Certified, and more. Their commitment to
    improving the health of their surrounding environment and in earning the trust of their customers is obvious from
    their many certifications.

    Ayrshire Farms specializes in raising livestock of rare and endangered breeds as well as growing heirloom fruits and
    veggies. Both of these activities are contributing to the preservation of these varieties and the biodiversity of
    the species. Some of the rare breeds they raise are Shire horses, Scottish Highland cattle, Ancient White Park
    cattle, Gloucestershire Old Spot hogs, and several breeds of free-range poultry including chickens, turkeys, and
    ducks. &nbsp;In addition to creating space for these endangered breeds of livestock, they also raise pheasants and
    wild turkey to be released into farm woodlands that have been replanted to provide wildlife corridors between
    habitats for native vegetation. In addition, the soil is being constantly amended with cover crops and compost from
    the three-acre compost facility. As a part of their training, the Ayrshire Shires help in the constant task of soil
    improvement, keeping the skills of horse-powered farming alive.
