                <h4>Delivered to your home, office, or building</h4>
                <p>We want to make getting Good Food delivered easy and affordable, while also minimizing our impact on the planet. We waive the delivery fee for home orders over $60 and all orders to participating delivery sites. Don&rsquo;t see your office or apartment building on our list of delivery sites? Reach out and let us know!</p>
                <h4>Skip or donate your delivery</h4>
                <p>Life happens, and you won&rsquo;t always need your regular 4P order. You can skip delivery as often as you need to (as long as you do it before your skip deadline). And if you forget to skip your bag in time, or just want to pay it forward, you can always opt to donate your bag to one of our food access partners.</p>
