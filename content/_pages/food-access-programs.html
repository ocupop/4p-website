        <p class="lead editable"><em>4P fights to build a better food system that enables all people, regardless of income or
            ZIP code, to have access to good, healthy food.</em></p>
        <p>Food Access (or lack thereof) is a multi-pronged problem touching on the areas of geography, financial, and
          personal. 4P Foods, together with our partners, helps to deliver food along with solutions that mirror those
          challenges.</p>

          <p>In our most successful program in Ward 7 (a “food desert,” where access to Good Food is highly limited), 4P Foods
          addresses the geographic access challenge by delivering into the neighborhood to a central community center, the
          Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy (YBA).</p> 
          <p>Each week at the YBA, we put on the Field of Greens market, offering
          the same fresh, healthy food that our members get in their bags each week, but at low to no cost, thanks to a USDA grant
          that 4P Foods, the YBA, and the YMCA received for the program. To address the personal access challenge, the YMCA puts
          on free cooking classes at the YBA using our food.</p>
