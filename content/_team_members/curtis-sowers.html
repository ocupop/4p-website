            <p>Curtis has been with the 4P Foods team since September 2019. He has a background in warehouse/delivery work, having worked for a wine and spirits distributor in Delaware for ten years, and he brings that experience to 4P, where he helps with portioning, packing, and delivering all the food that comes into and goes out of our warehouses each week. He loves the great folks he works with, and the spirit of what 4P does. Outside of work, he enjoys spending time with his family and four kids, ranging in age from four to fourteen. He is a huge music lover and amateur musician, playing and teaching guitar in his spare time.</p>
