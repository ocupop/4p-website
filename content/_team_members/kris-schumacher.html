  Depending on the day, it would be either a super-spicy baby mustard green, or
  a nice Cherokee Purple tomato with just a pinch of salt.

            <p>Kris&lsquo;s family has been involved in farming since the 1800&rsquo;s, both in the Mid-West and in Germany. He was raised &lsquo;off the grid&rsquo; on a sustainable tree farm in Rhode Island, where he developed a deep appreciation for responsible land management and sustainable agriculture. For the past 20+ years, he has worked in a wide range of professional roles with start-ups and large corporations, doing everything from producing special effects to structuring and negotiating multi-million dollar supply contracts. After living in the city for many years cut off from easy access to farm fresh food, and spending all of his time working in front of a computer for a multinational manufacturer, he realized that he needed to devote more time making a positive impact on the world, so he started growing vegetables at his farm in his spare time and selling them at the farmers market in Brooklyn where he became deeply involved in the Good Food movement and connected with 4P.</p>
