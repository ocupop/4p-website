            <p>Michael joined the 4P team in the summer of 2019. He has had a variety of tasks thrown his way since joining the team but has finally settled in as a sales associate. Michael has had a fun and exciting history in the agricultural world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>His dad has kept a large garden as far back as Michael can remember, but it was working at Heifer International&rsquo;s Ranch that peaked his interest in agriculture. Heifer Ranch is located in Perryville Arkansas and while there Michael worked in a large market garden that supplied CSA baskets to over 300 members. Michael was also able to practice animal husbandry with a variety of animals including camels, llamas and sheep. This is what got Michael excited and motivated to improve the food system in America and to find a way to make good food a Right for everyone. Recently Michael finished a USDA certified Urban Agriculture fellowship with Tricycle in Richmond. He is proud to have completed this fellowship and learned a great deal about the particular obstacles cities face in regard to accessible, healthy food.&nbsp; Michael has also worked at a few farms in the greater Richmond area and even co-founded a small farm business called Eighth&rsquo;N Acre.</p>
