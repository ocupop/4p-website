            <p>Sean recently joined the 4P Foods family as a warehouse guru. He is responsible for helping to maintain the warehouse by receiving and organizing new product deliveries!</p>
            <p>Sean was recently educated on the benefits of vegetarianism and he's been modifying his diet to be more plant-based. He's also supportive of local and sustainable food production. When he's not in the warehouse or driving, you can find him rock climbing, reading a book, or playing games with friends.</p>
