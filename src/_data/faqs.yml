    - question: What is available to order?
      answer_html: >-

        selection of regionally and responsibly sourced food. Once you are a
        customer you will have access to our Availability List.</p><p>You will
        also receive a weekly email with featured products and updates from 4P
        Foods.</p>
    - question: What are the order deadlines?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>For items that we stock in our warehouse regularly (vegetables,
        pantry &amp; frozen items) the order deadline is 12pm the business day
        prior. We kindly request our customers not to submit order changes
        (cancellations or add ons) after the order deadline (noon the business
        day prior) to ensure fulfillment of orders.  If you plan to order 4 or
        more cases of any one item it’s best to submit your order 7 business
        days in advance of the designated delivery day to assure we can get the
        quantity desired.</p>
    - question: What items are available for preorder?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>There are a handful of items on our list (chicken, milks, cheese,
        salsa, beef, etc) that we do not store in our warehouse, and instead
        order it fresh from the producers each week. Those items require about a
        week lead time for us to order it from them, then send it out to you.
        We'll be around to remind you when the deadlines are for any specific
        pre order items you're interested in. The Pre-order items are marked on
        the Wholesale Availability List with their schedule. </p>
    - question: Can I set up recurring orders?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Yes! We love recurring orders! A great way to avoid worrying about
        the pre order schedule/deadlines is to set up standing orders. We can
        set you up to automatically receive the items you most frequently order
        by the case every week without having to regularly ask for them.</p>

    - question: What is 4P Foods' mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values and support small and mid-sized family farmers and
        artisans by giving them access to new markets, while also helping ensure
        that all people have equitable access to the food produced by these
        farmers.</p><p>We believe food that is source identified and produced in
        a system that empowers farmers and regenerates the earth should be the
        norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that vision a
        reality each and every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a
        growing network of small family farms and artisan producers in the
        region, but also advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the
        communities we serve.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We source locally and regionally from a network of over 200
        small-to-mid-sized, independent farmers.</p><p>Why source regionally?
        For example, by sourcing regionally and using a network of other food
        hubs, we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their
        season up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond
        into mid-summer.</p><p>4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
        Collaborative, a network of other food hubs like us up and down the
        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Feel free to check out our
