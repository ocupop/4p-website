    - question: How does shopping with 4P Foods work?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We are your one-stop shop for local, regional, sustainable, and
        ethical produce, protein, dairy, pantry, and more (what we call "Good
        Food"). There are two ways to shop: <a
        href="https://shop.4pfoods.com/summary.php?go=products&amp;cat=93&amp;12"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">4P Bags</a> and a la carte.</p><p>4P Bags
        come in three types: Produce, Protein, and Dairy. Each of them will come
        "pre-packed" with 4P's Picks for that week, and then you can customize
        them by taking out or adding items to get just what you want.</p><p>You
        can order a Bag once to try it out, but our recommendation is to set up
        a recurring order so that you can be sure to have your fridge, freezer,
        and pantry stocked every week. You can always add on a la carte items,
        skip as often as you need, or cancel altogether with no
        penalty.</p><p>You can also order fully a la carte without a 4P Bag
        (don't worry, your order will still come packed in one of our lovely
        insulated reusable bags).</p>
    - question: How will I find out what food you have each week?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Each Saturday we update our online shop with what&rsquo;s fresh that
        week and send a Weekly Harvest Newsletter straight to your inbox, making
        it simple to decide what you want to order and plan what you&rsquo;ll
        cook for the week. We also include storage tips, recipe ideas, and
        highlights from our farmers and partners.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve
        signed up and are not receiving the email newsletter, be sure to check
        your spam or promotions folder, and then please <a href="/contact/">get
        in touch with us</a>&nbsp;so we can look into it.</p>
    - question: Is there a minimum commitment or signup fee?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Nope! There is no minimum commitment and no tricky sign-up policy.
        Our minimum order is $30 + delivery fee. You can order once to give us a
        try, or sign up for a recurring subscription and still cancel anytime
        before your skip deadline with no fees! If you were anything less than
        satisfied with your order, please do&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">get in
        touch</a> with our member experience team first so that we can try to
        make things right.</p>
    - question: If I sign up for a subscription, can I skip orders?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Absolutely. You always have the ability to skip individual orders, or
        place a delivery hold for a certain period of time. All we ask is that
        you skip any upcoming deliveries ahead of the 2-day cut-off period,
        during which time we finalize orders with farmers. The cut-off begins at
        <strong>11:59 pm on Sunday</strong> for a Wednesday delivery,
        <strong>11:59 pm on Monday</strong> for a Thursday delivery, and
        <strong>11:59 pm on Tuesday</strong> for a Friday delivery.&nbsp;</p>
    - question: How does billing work? Do I pay upfront?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We do our billing every Sunday for the prior week’s deliveries. So if
        you get a bag on Wednesday, you’ll be billed the following weekend. If
        you skip your order, you won’t be billed that week.</p>
    - question: What if I'm allergic to something that's coming in my 4P Foods Bag?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>That’s where the customization function comes in! Be sure to login to
        your account between Saturday afternoon and your order deadline (11:59pm
        three days before your delivery day) to customize your order and swap
        out any items you can’t enjoy.</p>
    - question: What is 4P's mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values and support small and mid-sized family farmers and
        artisans by giving them access to new markets, while also helping ensure
        that all people have equitable access to the Good Food produced by these
        farmers.</p><p>We believe that Good Food&mdash; food that is traceable,
        nutritious, accessible, and produced in a system that empowers farmers
        and sustains the environment&mdash; should be the norm, not the
        exception, and we actively work to make that vision a reality each and
        every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a growing network of
        small family farms and artisan producers in the region, but also
        advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the communities we
        serve.</p>
    - question: Is there a delivery fee?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Please note that delivery takes time and energy and an amazing
        delivery team. There is a fee of $9.95 for orders under $85 and $6.95
        for orders over $85. Since we are awesome humans (and not drones)
        delivering your food with care, hopefully you’ll agree that it’s totally
        worth it.</p><p>Delivery is free at <a

        <p>For items that we stock in our warehouse regularly (vegetables,
        pantry &amp; frozen items) the order deadline is 12pm the business day
        prior. We kindly request our customers not to submit order changes
        (cancellations or add ons) after the order deadline (noon the business
        day prior) to ensure fulfillment of orders.  If you plan to order 4 or

        details.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We source locally and regionally from a network of over 200
        small-to-mid-sized, independent farmers.</p><p>Why source regionally?
        For example, by sourcing regionally and using a network of other food
        hubs, we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their
        season up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond
        into mid-summer.</p><p>4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
        Collaborative, a network of other food hubs like us up and down the
        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Feel free to check out our
        growing collection of <a href="https://4pfoods.com/farmers">farmer

        it.</p>
- title: Delivery
  faqs:
    - question: How does delivery work?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>All of our deliveries are contactless, and you should receive an
        automatic email or text notification when a driver drops off your
        bags.</p><p>In general, if you signed up for direct home delivery, we
        usually deliver the bags right to your doorstep, or wherever you
        indicated in your delivery instructions (if we don’t deliver to the
        right place, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>&nbsp;to let us
        know!).</p><p>For commercial buildings or apartment complexes, we
        deliver the bags per the building’s protocols and your
        directions.</p><p>In an effort to maximize delivery efficiency and
        minimize contact during the busiest hours of the day, your delivery may
        arrive as early as 7:00AM and as late as 8:00PM.&nbsp;</p>
    - question: Is there a delivery fee?

        delivery team. There is a fee of $9.95 for orders under $85 and $6.95
        for orders over $85. Since we are awesome humans (and not drones)

        time frame to save C02 and save a few bucks.</p>
    - question: What are Community Pick-up Sites and how can I join?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We've teamed up with select <a
        href="/posts/why-sign-up-for-a-4p-foods-pick-up-site-free-delivery/">community
        centers and local businesses to be pickup points</a> for 4P deliveries.
        Having your bags dropped off to a pick-up site helps us curb CO2 and
        helps you save money, as we'll waive the delivery fee on all
        orders!</p><p>New customers can choose a Community Pickup Site as your
        delivery location while registering, and anyone can change their
        delivery location to a 4P Community Pick-up Site (or vis versa) from
        your 4P Foods account. To see if there are any sites near you, simply
        log in to your account, click "Account Info," and navigate to the
        dropdown below “Do you want Pickup or Delivery?’ for a list of
        participating locations. Just note that you'll need to be able to pickup
        your bags during their business hours. Don't see a pick-up site near
        you? <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> if you know of a place near you

    - question: What is my delivery day?

        process, but if you’re unsure, you can login into your account, click on
        “My Account” in the upper right hand corner, then click on “Upcoming
        Deliveries” to see all of your upcoming delivery dates. Any general news
        or changes in deliveries will be communicated to you directly and/or
        will be included in the weekly newsletter.</p><p>If you’re still
        unsure,&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">reach out</a>&nbsp;and we'll be happy
        to assist you!</p>
    - question: Will the food stay fresh after it is delivered?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>You will receive an email or text notification when a driver drops
        off your bags. We deliver our food in insulated packaging to keep
        everything cold. We'd recommend picking up and unpacking your bags as
        soon as you can, but as long as you can do so within a few hours (or
        longer in cooler weather), you should be fine. We take all the packaging
        back to sanitize and reuse, so please set out your empties on delivery
        day for our driver to swap out.</p>
    - question: What if something in my delivery is missing or damaged?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>If you receive any disappointing items, or if anything is missing,
        please let us know! We’ll gladly try to correct whatever happened,
        whether through a credit or an extra item in your next
        delivery.</p><p>We do our best to closely manage inventory so that we
        have enough for all orders but not so much that anything goes to waste.
        If we ever run out of an item or it becomes unavailable after you have
        placed your order, we'll do our best to notify you in advance so you can
        let us know what you’d like instead. If we're unable get in touch in
        time, we’ll issue you a credit for the missing item (or send you a
        substitute item in select circumstances, i.e. pack gala apples as a
        substitute for stayman apples, if out of stock).</p>
- title: About Us
  faqs:
    - question: How are you different than other online food delivery services?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We bring the freshest, highest-quality produce, meat, dairy, and
        pantry goods right to your doorstep from farmers and producers in the
        Mid-Atlantic region (and <a
        href="/posts/whats-in-the-winter-bag/">sometimes beyond</a>) who <a
        href="/posts/good-food-knows-no-boundaries/">share our values of Good
        Food</a>. With 4P, you are voting with your fork for a more sustainable
        and equitable food system for everyone.</p><p>Our produce offerings vary
        with the seasons. In the Spring, you’ll see asparagus and strawberries.
        In the summer, tomatoes and sweet corn. Autumn equals apples and leafy
        greens. And in the Winter, it’s a mix of local greenhouse-grown produce
        like lettuce and storage crops like butternut squash, artisan goods from
        local makers, and fruits and vegetables from farmers further
        south.&nbsp;</p><p>Year-round, we offer great local meats and dairy from
        animals raised on open pasture and treated with dignity throughout their
        lives, as well as delicious pantry goods like pastas, jams, and more
        made by local artisans. We also aim to curb waste by packaging food in
        eco-friendly totes that are returned and reused.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>The short answer: we source locally and regionally from a network of
        over 200 small, independent farmers, most of them located in the
        Mid-Atlantic. Does that mean it&rsquo;s &ldquo;local?&rdquo; That
        depends on where you live and how you define it, so we often use the
        term &ldquo;regional&rdquo; to describe our sourcing
        practices.</p><p>The longer answer: it depends on the item and the
        season. Avocados don&rsquo;t grow in the Mid-Atlantic, so we buy them
        from a fair-trade cooperative in Peru (read more about our sourcing of
        tropical items on our blog <a
        href="/posts/the-geography-of-good-food/">here</a>). As another example,
        we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their season
        up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond into
        mid-summer. 4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
        Collaborative, a network of other food hubs like us up and down the
        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Read our growing collection
        of <a href="/farmers">farmer profiles</a> for more information about our
        food and the people behind it.</p>
    - question: Is all the food organic? What about non-GMO?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Some of it is USDA-certified organic, and some of it is not (not all
        farmers who use organic practices choose to get certified). While
        certifications are certainly important, what is most important to us
        is&nbsp;<a href="/posts/good-food-knows-no-boundaries/">Good
        Food</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Good Food provides nourishment and enables
        people to thrive, is equitably accessible to everyone in the region, is
        produced in a manner that is environmentally regenerative, comes from a
        supply chain in which every being is treated with respect and dignity,
        and improves health outcomes and economic security for
        all.</p></blockquote><p>We work with farmers who are good stewards of
        their resources, including land, water, and labor. Our&nbsp;<a
        href="/farmers">farmer profiles</a>&nbsp;are a great place to get more
        information about each farmer and their growing practices. While we
        embrace a local and regional food system, you can choose to&nbsp;<a
        href="/how-to-shop/">customize</a>&nbsp;your bags to include only local
        products, for example.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to be 100% supporting
        regenerative agriculture. Regenerative agriculture seeks not only to
        maintain but also to increase soil health, carbon sequestration, and
        biodiversity.</p>
    - question: What is 4P Foods' Mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values via a short, transparent supply chain and to know
        that you are supporting a company seeking far more than profit (in fact,
        the 4P's are an expansion of the idea of the triple bottom line: People,
        Planet, Prosperity, and Purpose). Everything we do aims to help small
        and mid-sized family farmers and artisans not just to survive, but to
        thrive, while also helping ensure that all people have equitable access
        to the Good Food produced by these farmers.</p><p>We believe that Good
        Food— food that is traceable, nutritious, accessible, and produced in a
        system that empowers farmers and sustains the environment— should be the
        norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that vision a
        reality each and every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a
        growing network of small family farms and artisan producers in the
        region, but also advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the
        communities we serve.</p>
    - question: How can I order extra items?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>After you choose your bag(s), head over to the shop to browse that
        week&rsquo;s available items and add anything you would like. You can
        choose if you want this item just one time, or on a recurring basis
        (based on availability).&nbsp;</p><p>Can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re
        looking for? Try clicking the magnifying glass in the corner to search
        for a specific item.</p>
    - question: What should I do with the old bags?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We carefully inspect, sanitize, and reuse them, so we would love to
        have them back! To help minimize both cost and waste, please return the
        old bags, cooler boxes (tote bag, cooler packs, and insulated box
        included), and any glass milk bottles to the same place where your bags
        were dropped off. We&rsquo;ll send you a reminder email the day before
        your delivery so that our driver can pick them when they deliver the
        next day. We&rsquo;ll then sanitize them for reuse. With your help,
        it&rsquo;s a win-win! Thank you!</p>

    - question: How do you  address racial equity in the food system?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Right off the bat, we want to acknowledge that the food system has
        traditionally done a lot of harm to BIPOC communities, from colonization
        to slavery to the poor treatment of immigrant farm laborers. We are
        intentionally working to increase our sourcing from BIPOC farmers and to
        center equity in our daily work as a company. You can read more about
        racial injustice in the food system and 4P&rsquo;s response in this <a

        from our founder &amp; CEO</a>, Tom McDougall.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>The short answer: we source locally and regionally from a network of
        independent farmers, most of them located in the Mid-Atlantic. Does that
        mean it’s “local?” That depends on where you live and how you define it,
        so we often use the term “regional” to describe our sourcing
        practices.</p><p>The longer answer: it depends on the item and the
        season. Avocados don’t grow in the Mid-Atlantic, so we buy them from a
        fair-trade cooperative in Peru (read more about our sourcing of tropical
        items on our blog <a
        href="/posts/the-geography-of-good-food/">here</a>). As another example,
        we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their season
        up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond into
        mid-summer. 4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
        Collaborative, a network of other food hubs like us up and down the
        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Read our growing collection
