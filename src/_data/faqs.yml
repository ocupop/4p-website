    - question: What is available to order?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our Wholesale Availability List has a detailed look at our full
        selection of regionally and responsibly sourced food. Once you are a
        customer you will have access to our Availability List.</p><p>You will
        also receive a weekly email with featured products and updates from 4P
        Foods.</p>
    - question: What are the order deadlines?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>For items that we stock in our warehouse regularly (vegetables,
        pantry &amp; frozen items) the order deadline is 12pm the business day
        prior. We kindly request our customers not to submit order changes
        (cancellations or add ons) after the order deadline (noon the business
        day prior) to ensure fulfillment of orders.  If you plan to order 4 or
        more cases of any one item it’s best to submit your order 7 business
        days in advance of the designated delivery day to assure we can get the
        quantity desired.</p>
    - question: What items are available for preorder?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>There are a handful of items on our list (chicken, milks, cheese,
        salsa, beef, etc) that we do not store in our warehouse, and instead
        order it fresh from the producers each week. Those items require about a
        week lead time for us to order it from them, then send it out to you.
        We'll be around to remind you when the deadlines are for any specific
        pre order items you're interested in. The Pre-order items are marked on
        the Wholesale Availability List with their schedule. </p>
    - question: Can I set up recurring orders?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Yes! We love recurring orders! A great way to avoid worrying about
        the pre order schedule/deadlines is to set up standing orders. We can
        set you up to automatically receive the items you most frequently order
        by the case every week without having to regularly ask for them.</p>

  faqs:
    - question: What is 4P Foods' mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values and support small and mid-sized family farmers and
        artisans by giving them access to new markets, while also helping ensure
        that all people have equitable access to the food produced by these
        farmers.</p><p>We believe food that is source identified and produced in
        a system that empowers farmers and regenerates the earth should be the
        norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that vision a
        reality each and every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a
        growing network of small family farms and artisan producers in the
        region, but also advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the
        communities we serve.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We source locally and regionally from a network of over 200
        small-to-mid-sized, independent farmers.</p><p>Why source regionally?
        For example, by sourcing regionally and using a network of other food
        hubs, we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their
        season up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond
        into mid-summer.</p><p>4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
        Collaborative, a network of other food hubs like us up and down the
        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Feel free to check out our
        growing collection of farmer profiles for more information about our
        food and the people behind it.</p>
    - question: Is all the food organic? What about non-GMO?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Some of it is USDA-certified organic, and some of it is not (not all
        farmers who use organic practices choose to get certified). While
        certifications are certainly important, what is most important to us
        is&nbsp;<a href="/posts/good-food-knows-no-boundaries/">Good
        Food</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Good Food provides nourishment and enables
        people to thrive, is equitably accessible to everyone in the region, is
        produced in a manner that is environmentally regenerative, comes from a
        supply chain in which every being is treated with respect and dignity,
        and improves health outcomes and economic security for
        all.</p></blockquote><p>We work with farmers who are good stewards of
        their resources, including land, water, and labor. Our&nbsp;<a
        href="/farmers">farmer profiles</a>&nbsp;are a great place to get more
        information about each farmer and their growing practices. While we
        embrace a local and regional food system, you can choose to&nbsp;<a
        href="/how-to-shop/">customize</a>&nbsp;your bags to include only local
        products, for example.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to be 100% supporting
        regenerative agriculture. Regenerative agriculture seeks not only to
        maintain but also to increase soil health, carbon sequestration, and
        biodiversity.</p>
    - question: What is 4P Foods' Mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values via a short, transparent supply chain and to know
        that you are supporting a company seeking far more than profit (in fact,
        the 4P's are an expansion of the idea of the triple bottom line: People,
        Planet, Prosperity, and Purpose). Everything we do aims to help small
        and mid-sized family farmers and artisans not just to survive, but to
        thrive, while also helping ensure that all people have equitable access
        to the Good Food produced by these farmers.</p><p>We believe that Good
        Food— food that is traceable, nutritious, accessible, and produced in a
        system that empowers farmers and sustains the environment— should be the
        norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that vision a
        reality each and every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a
        growing network of small family farms and artisan producers in the
        region, but also advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the
        communities we serve.</p>
    - question: How can I order extra items?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>After you choose your bag(s), head over to the shop to browse that
        week&rsquo;s available items and add anything you would like. You can
        choose if you want this item just one time, or on a recurring basis
        (based on availability).&nbsp;</p><p>Can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re
        looking for? Try clicking the magnifying glass in the corner to search
        for a specific item.</p>
    - question: What should I do with the old bags?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We carefully inspect, sanitize, and reuse them, so we would love to
        have them back! To help minimize both cost and waste, please return the
        old bags, cooler boxes (tote bag, cooler packs, and insulated box
        included), and any glass milk bottles to the same place where your bags
        were dropped off. We&rsquo;ll send you a reminder email the day before
        your delivery so that our driver can pick them when they deliver the
        next day. We&rsquo;ll then sanitize them for reuse. With your help,
        it&rsquo;s a win-win! Thank you!</p>

        serve.</p>
    - question: How do you  address racial equity in the food system?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Right off the bat, we want to acknowledge that the food system has
        traditionally done a lot of harm to BIPOC communities, from colonization
        to slavery to the poor treatment of immigrant farm laborers. We are
        intentionally working to increase our sourcing from BIPOC farmers and to
        center equity in our daily work as a company. You can read more about
        racial injustice in the food system and 4P&rsquo;s response in this <a
        href="/posts/we-stand-with-all-of-you-we-stand-against-racism/">letter
        from our founder &amp; CEO</a>, Tom McDougall.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>The short answer: we source locally and regionally from a network of
        independent farmers, most of them located in the Mid-Atlantic. Does that
        mean it’s “local?” That depends on where you live and how you define it,
        so we often use the term “regional” to describe our sourcing
        practices.</p><p>The longer answer: it depends on the item and the
        season. Avocados don’t grow in the Mid-Atlantic, so we buy them from a
        fair-trade cooperative in Peru (read more about our sourcing of tropical
        items on our blog <a
        href="/posts/the-geography-of-good-food/">here</a>). As another example,
        we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their season
        up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond into
        mid-summer. 4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub

    - question: What do you mean by "Good Food"?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Here's how we define Good Food:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>provides nourishment
        and enables people to thrive.</li><li>is equitably accessible to
        everyone in our region, regardless of income, race, or zip
        code.</li><li>is produced in a manner that is environmentally
        regenerative.</li><li>comes from a supply chain in which every being is
        treated with respect and dignity.</li><li>improves health outcomes and
        economic security for all.</li></ol>
