    - question: How does shopping with 4P Foods work?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We are your one-stop shop for local, regional, sustainable, and
        ethical produce, protein, dairy, pantry, and more (what we call "Good
        Food"). There are two ways to shop: <a
        href="https://shop.4pfoods.com/summary.php?go=products&amp;cat=93&amp;12"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">4P Bags</a> and a la carte.</p><p>4P Bags
        come in three types: Produce, Protein, and Dairy. Each of them will come
        "pre-packed" with 4P's Picks for that week, and then you can customize
        them by taking out or adding items to get just what you want.</p><p>You
        can order a Bag once to try it out, but our recommendation is to set up
        a recurring order so that you can be sure to have your fridge, freezer,
        and pantry stocked every week. You can always add on a la carte items,
        skip as often as you need, or cancel altogether with no
        penalty.</p><p>You can also order fully a la carte without a 4P Bag
        (don't worry, your order will still come packed in one of our lovely
        insulated reusable bags).</p>
    - question: How will I find out what food you have each week?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Each Saturday we update our online shop with what&rsquo;s fresh that
        week and send a Weekly Harvest Newsletter straight to your inbox, making
        it simple to decide what you want to order and plan what you&rsquo;ll
        cook for the week. We also include storage tips, recipe ideas, and
        highlights from our farmers and partners.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve
        signed up and are not receiving the email newsletter, be sure to check
        your spam or promotions folder, and then please <a href="/contact/">get
        in touch with us</a>&nbsp;so we can look into it.</p>
    - question: Is there a minimum commitment or signup fee?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Nope! There is no minimum commitment and no tricky sign-up policy.
        Our minimum order is $30 + delivery fee. You can order once to give us a
        try, or sign up for a recurring subscription and still cancel anytime
        before your skip deadline with no fees! If you were anything less than
        satisfied with your order, please do&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">get in
        touch</a> with our member experience team first so that we can try to
        make things right.</p>
    - question: If I sign up for a subscription, can I skip orders?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Absolutely. You always have the ability to skip individual orders, or
        place a delivery hold for a certain period of time. All we ask is that
        you skip any upcoming deliveries ahead of the 2-day cut-off period,
        during which time we finalize orders with farmers. The cut-off begins at
        <strong>11:59 pm on Sunday</strong> for a Wednesday delivery,
        <strong>11:59 pm on Monday</strong> for a Thursday delivery, and
        <strong>11:59 pm on Tuesday</strong> for a Friday delivery.&nbsp;</p>
    - question: How does billing work? Do I pay upfront?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We do our billing every Sunday for the prior week’s deliveries. So if
        you get a bag on Wednesday, you’ll be billed the following weekend. If
        you skip your order, you won’t be billed that week.</p>
    - question: What if I'm allergic to something that's coming in my 4P Foods Bag?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>That’s where the customization function comes in! Be sure to login to
        your account between Saturday afternoon and your order deadline (11:59pm
        three days before your delivery day) to customize your order and swap
        out any items you can’t enjoy.</p>
    - question: What is 4P's mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values and support small and mid-sized family farmers and
        artisans by giving them access to new markets, while also helping ensure
        that all people have equitable access to the Good Food produced by these
        farmers.</p><p>We believe that Good Food&mdash; food that is traceable,
        nutritious, accessible, and produced in a system that empowers farmers
        and sustains the environment&mdash; should be the norm, not the
        exception, and we actively work to make that vision a reality each and
        every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a growing network of
        small family farms and artisan producers in the region, but also
        advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the communities we
        serve.</p>
    - question: Is there a delivery fee?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Please note that delivery takes time and energy and an amazing
        delivery team. There is a fee of $9.95 for orders under $85 and $6.95
        for orders over $85. Since we are awesome humans (and not drones)
        delivering your food with care, hopefully you’ll agree that it’s totally
        worth it.</p><p>Delivery is free at <a
        href="https://4pfoods.com/posts/4p-foods-community-pickup-sites/">community
        pick-up sites</a>, where anyone can pick up their bags within a certain

      answer_html: >-
        <p>Check out our <a href="/farmers">Farmers page</a>! We’re always
        updating it, so stay tuned for more profiles of the many amazing
        farmers, ranchers, and artisans from whom we source.</p>

    - question: How do you  address racial equity in the food system?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Right off the bat, we want to acknowledge that the food system has
        traditionally done a lot of harm to BIPOC communities, from colonization
        to slavery to the poor treatment of immigrant farm laborers. We are
        intentionally working to increase our sourcing from BIPOC farmers and to
        center equity in our daily work as a company. You can read more about
        racial injustice in the food system and 4P&rsquo;s response in this <a
        href="/posts/we-stand-with-all-of-you-we-stand-against-racism/">letter
        from our founder &amp; CEO</a>, Tom McDougall.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>The short answer: we source locally and regionally from a network of
        independent farmers, most of them located in the Mid-Atlantic. Does that
        mean it’s “local?” That depends on where you live and how you define it,
        so we often use the term “regional” to describe our sourcing
        practices.</p><p>The longer answer: it depends on the item and the
        season. Avocados don’t grow in the Mid-Atlantic, so we buy them from a
        fair-trade cooperative in Peru (read more about our sourcing of tropical
        items on our blog <a
        href="/posts/the-geography-of-good-food/">here</a>). As another example,
        we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their season
        up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond into
        mid-summer. 4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
        Collaborative, a network of other food hubs like us up and down the
        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Read our growing collection
        of <a href="/farmers">farmer profiles</a> for more information about our
        food.</p>
    - question: What do you mean by "Good Food"?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Here's how we define Good Food:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>provides nourishment
        and enables people to thrive.</li><li>is equitably accessible to
        everyone in our region, regardless of income, race, or zip
        code.</li><li>is produced in a manner that is environmentally
        regenerative.</li><li>comes from a supply chain in which every being is
        treated with respect and dignity.</li><li>improves health outcomes and
        economic security for all.</li></ol>
- title: Shopping
  faqs:
    - question: When can I customize my 4P Foods Bags?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>On Saturdays, we update the 4P Bags and our online shop with what’s
        fresh for the week. When the Weekly Harvest Newsletter hits your inbox,
        it means your bags are ready to customize! Our ETA is mid-day on
        Saturdays, but there are occasional delays due to mother nature or
        technology. The arrival of the newsletter alerts you that you have
        between then and your order deadline (<em>three days before your
        delivery day at 11:59 pm</em>) to customize your Bags and/or add a la
        carte items.</p>
    - question: How do I see what's coming in my next delivery?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>There are two ways to view your upcoming deliveries:</p><ol><li>From
        My Account &gt; Upcoming Deliveries: hover or click on My Account and
        select Upcoming Deliveries from the menu. On this page, you'll see the
        next six weeks of delivery days and any deliveries you have scheduled or
        skipped, as well as the option to skip, donate, or restore upcoming
        orders. Click the "Customize" button to see what you have coming in any
        bags.</li><li>From the cart: click on the bag icon in the upper right
        corner. You'll see the next six weeks of delivery days, with a number
        next to each date indicating how many items are in your bag that week.
        Click the "Customize" button to see what you have coming in any
        bags.</li></ol>
    - question: How do I know if my order is “done”?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>There’s no checkout button on your shopping cart. As long as you hit
        the $30 order minimum, you’re good to go.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there
        <em>is</em> a “Save” button you need to click to finish the customizing
        process for a 4P bag.</p><p>Whenever you make changes to your order
        (including adding or removing items or customizing a bag), you’ll get a
        confirmation email. When you change a recurring order, you’ll get emails
        for the future deliveries, as well. If you don’t want to get a
        confirmation email every time, you can hit “Unsubscribe” at the bottom
        of the email to update your email preferences for different types of
        emails.</p>
    - question: When is the order deadline each week?
      answer_html: >-
        <p><strong>The deadline to make any customizations to your 4P order is a
        full 48 hours before your delivery day. </strong>Please be mindful of
        this cut-off which gives us a chance to finalize orders with farmers and
        artisans! The order deadline by delivery day is as
        follows:</p><ul><li>11:59 pm on Sunday for a Wednesday
        delivery</li><li>11:59 pm on Monday for a Thursday
        delivery</li><li>11:59 pm on Tuesday for a Friday delivery</li></ul>
    - question: How do I skip an order, or multiple orders at once?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>To skip once, login to your account and click on “My Account” in the
        upper right hand corner and then click on “Upcoming Deliveries.” You’ll
        see the orders you have scheduled for the next six weeks, including the
        items and total cost, and you’ll also see buttons that allow you to skip
        or donate each individual order.</p><p>If you choose to skip, you won’t
        be charged for your order that week. If you choose to donate, you will
        be charged, and your order will be packed up and delivered to one of our
        food assistance partners, like the <a
        href="/posts/fauquier-community-food-bank/">Fauquier Community Food
        Bank</a>.</p><p>You can skip for a longer period of time by turning on a
        Vacation Hold. Under “My Account” click on “Delivery Hold” and enter
        your vacation dates - we will skip all deliveries scheduled that fall
        between the date you entered to leave and the date you entered to
        return.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need any assistance skipping a delivery,
        please <a href="/contact/">reach out to us</a> and we'll be happy to

    - question: I only want to order a small amount of dairy or protein--can I do that?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Select dairy and protein items can be purchased a la carte, including
        eggs and butter. Take a look through the Dairy &amp; Eggs and Protein
        sections of the shop to see what is available to add to your
        cart.&nbsp;</p><p>All orders must meet the $30 minimum to be
        delivered.</p>
    - question: How can I tell what’s in my bag while I’m customizing?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>From the shop, click on “What’s Inside” on any bag image to see
        what’s available for a given week (if there are multiple weeks
        available, you can switch between them in the dropdown list at the top).
        Any items highlighted in pale yellow are what’s coming in the standard
        bag that week.</p><p>Once you’ve added a bag to your cart, click
        “Customize” to go to the Customize page (you can also navigate there
        from the “Upcoming Deliveries” page under “My Account.”) Bags will be
        pre-packed with the 4P Picks for the Week, which will show up in yellow
        with a green checkmark at the top of the product list. Products you
        remove will uncheck and change from yellow to white, and products you
        add will check and change from white to yellow. You can see a summary of
        your bag in the list in the “What’s Inside” section on the right in
        desktop view or at the top in mobile view.</p>
    - question: >-
        It takes me a long time to scroll through all of the options while I’m
        customizing. Is there a quicker way to find what I want?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Sure is! On the Customize page, click on the product categories under
        “Customize Bag Contents” to jump to that type of product (i.e. “Fruits”
        in the produce bag or “Beef” in the protein bag).</p>
    - question: >-
        I used to get pantry items in my produce bag, but now I don’t see them
        available as swaps. Where did the pantry items go?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Most pantry items have changed from bag items to a la carte items,
        meaning you can add them on to any order, no saving up points required.
        Click &ldquo;Pantry&rdquo; in the navigation bar at the top of the shop
        to see the full selection.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t need as many produce
        items as come in a produce bag in addition to your pantry items,
        we&rsquo;ve got you covered! Build a fully a la carte order by selecting
        exactly the individual items that you want from each category--anything
        that can be added to your cart from the shop is available a la carte. As
        long as you hit the $30 minimum order, you&rsquo;re good to go, no
        Produce, Protein, or Dairy Bag required.</p>

        bags.</p><p>In general, if you signed up for direct home delivery, we

      answer_html: >-
        <p>You will receive an email or text notification when a driver drops
        off your bags. We deliver our food in insulated packaging to keep
        everything cold. We'd recommend picking up and unpacking your bags as
        soon as you can, but as long as you can do so within a few hours (or
        longer in cooler weather), you should be fine. We take all the packaging
        back to sanitize and reuse, so please set out your empties on delivery
        day for our driver to swap out.</p>

        delivery.</p><p>We do our best to closely manage inventory so that we
        have enough for all orders but not so much that anything goes to waste.
        If we ever run out of an item or it becomes unavailable after you have
        placed your order, we'll do our best to notify you in advance so you can
        let us know what you’d like instead. If we're unable get in touch in
        time, we’ll issue you a credit for the missing item (or send you a
        substitute item in select circumstances, i.e. pack gala apples as a
        substitute for stayman apples, if out of stock).</p>

  faqs:
    - question: How are you different than other online food delivery services?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We bring the freshest, highest-quality produce, meat, dairy, and
        pantry goods right to your doorstep from farmers and producers in the
        Mid-Atlantic region (and <a
        href="/posts/whats-in-the-winter-bag/">sometimes beyond</a>) who <a

        everyone.</p><p>Our produce offerings vary with the seasons. In the
        Spring, you&rsquo;ll see asparagus and strawberries. In the summer,
        tomatoes and sweet corn. Autumn equals apples and leafy greens. And in
        the Winter, it&rsquo;s a mix of local greenhouse-grown produce like
        lettuce and storage crops like butternut squash, artisan goods from
        local makers, and fruits and vegetables from farmers further
        south.&nbsp;</p><p>Year-round, we offer great local meats and dairy from
        animals raised on open pasture and treated with dignity throughout their
        lives, as well as delicious pantry goods like pastas, jams, and more
        made by local artisans. We also aim to curb waste by packaging food in
        eco-friendly totes that are returned and reused.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>The short answer: we source locally and regionally from a network of
        over 200 small, independent farmers, most of them located in the
        Mid-Atlantic. Does that mean it&rsquo;s &ldquo;local?&rdquo; That
        depends on where you live and how you define it, so we often use the

        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Read our growing collection

    - question: Is all the food organic? What about non-GMO?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Some of it is USDA-certified organic, and some of it is not (not all
        farmers who use organic practices choose to get certified). While
        certifications are certainly important, what is most important to us
        is&nbsp;<a href="/posts/good-food-knows-no-boundaries/">Good
        Food</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Good Food provides nourishment and enables
        people to thrive, is equitably accessible to everyone in the region, is
        produced in a manner that is environmentally regenerative, comes from a
        supply chain in which every being is treated with respect and dignity,
        and improves health outcomes and economic security for
        all.</p></blockquote><p>We work with farmers who are good stewards of
        their resources, including land, water, and labor. Our&nbsp;<a
        href="/farmers">farmer profiles</a>&nbsp;are a great place to get more
        information about each farmer and their growing practices. While we
        embrace a local and regional food system, you can choose to&nbsp;<a
        href="/how-to-shop/">customize</a>&nbsp;your bags to include only local
        products, for example.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to be 100% supporting
        regenerative agriculture. Regenerative agriculture seeks not only to
        maintain but also to increase soil health, carbon sequestration, and
        biodiversity.</p>
    - question: What is 4P Foods' Mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values via a short, transparent supply chain and to know
        that you are supporting a company seeking far more than profit (in fact,
        the 4P's are an expansion of the idea of the triple bottom line: People,
        Planet, Prosperity, and Purpose). Everything we do aims to help small
        and mid-sized family farmers and artisans not just to survive, but to
        thrive, while also helping ensure that all people have equitable access
        to the Good Food produced by these farmers.</p><p>We believe that Good
        Food— food that is traceable, nutritious, accessible, and produced in a
        system that empowers farmers and sustains the environment— should be the
        norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that vision a
        reality each and every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a
        growing network of small family farms and artisan producers in the
        region, but also advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the
        communities we serve.</p>
    - question: How can I order extra items?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>After you choose your bag(s), head over to the shop to browse that
        week&rsquo;s available items and add anything you would like. You can
        choose if you want this item just one time, or on a recurring basis
        (based on availability).&nbsp;</p><p>Can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re
        looking for? Try clicking the magnifying glass in the corner to search
        for a specific item.</p>
    - question: What should I do with the old bags?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We carefully inspect, sanitize, and reuse them, so we would love to
        have them back! To help minimize both cost and waste, please return the
        old bags, cooler boxes (tote bag, cooler packs, and insulated box
        included), and any glass milk bottles to the same place where your bags
        were dropped off. We&rsquo;ll send you a reminder email the day before
        your delivery so that our driver can pick them when they deliver the
        next day. We&rsquo;ll then sanitize them for reuse. With your help,
        it&rsquo;s a win-win! Thank you!</p>

    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We source locally and regionally from a network of over 200
        small-to-mid-sized, independent farmers.</p><p>Why source regionally?
        For example, by sourcing regionally and using a network of other food
        hubs, we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their
        season up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond
        into mid-summer.</p><p>4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
