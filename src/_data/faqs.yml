    - question: How does shopping with 4P Foods work?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We are your one-stop shop for local, regional, sustainable, and
        ethical produce, protein, dairy, pantry, and more (what we call "Good
        Food"). There are two ways to shop: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
        href="https://shop.4pfoods.com/summary.php?go=products&amp;cat=93&amp;12">4P
        Bags</a> and a la carte.</p><p>4P Bags come in four types: Produce,
        Protein, Dairy, and Fruit. Each of them will come "pre-packed" with 4P's
        Picks for that week, and then you can customize them by taking out or
        adding items to get just what you want. It doesn't matter how many items
        you have in a Bag, so long as you hit the minimum for that Bag, which
        you'll see in the description.</p><p>You can order a Bag once to try it
        out, but our recommendation is to set up a recurring order so that you
        can be sure to have your fridge, freezer, and pantry stocked every week.
        You can always add on a la carte items, skip as often as you need, or
        cancel altogether with no penalty.</p><p>You can also order fully a la
        carte without a 4P Bag (don't worry, your order will still come packed
        in one of our lovely insulated reusable bags).</p>
    - question: How will I find out what food you have each week?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Each Saturday we update our online shop with what&rsquo;s fresh that
        week and send a Weekly Harvest Newsletter straight to your inbox, making
        it simple to decide what you want to order and plan what you&rsquo;ll
        cook for the week. We also include storage tips, recipe ideas, and
        highlights from our farmers and partners.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve
        signed up and are not receiving the email newsletter, be sure to check
        your spam or promotions folder, and then please <a href="/contact/">get
        in touch with us</a>&nbsp;so we can look into it.</p>
    - question: Is there a minimum commitment or signup fee?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Nope! There is no minimum commitment and no tricky sign-up policy.
        Our minimum order is $30 + delivery fee. You can order once to give us a
        try, or sign up for a recurring subscription and still cancel anytime
        before your skip deadline with no fees! If you were anything less than
        satisfied with your order, please do&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">get in
        touch</a> with our member experience team first so that we can try to
        make things right.</p>
    - question: If I sign up for a subscription, can I skip orders?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Absolutely. You always have the ability to skip individual orders, or
        place a delivery hold for a certain period of time. All we ask is that
        you skip any upcoming deliveries ahead of the 2-day cut-off period,
        during which time we finalize orders with farmers. The cut-off begins at
        <strong>11:59 pm on Sunday</strong> for a Wednesday delivery,
        <strong>11:59 pm on Monday</strong> for a Thursday delivery, and
        <strong>11:59 pm on Tuesday</strong> for a Friday delivery.&nbsp;</p>
    - question: How does billing work? Do I pay upfront?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We do our billing every Saturday for the prior week&rsquo;s
        deliveries. So if you get a bag on Wednesday, you&rsquo;ll be billed the
        following weekend. If you skip your order, you won&rsquo;t be billed
        that week.</p>
    - question: What if I'm allergic to something that's coming in my 4P Bag?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>That&rsquo;s where the customization function comes in! Be sure to
        login to your account between Saturday afternoon and your order deadline
        (11:59pm three days before your delivery day) to customize your order
        and swap out any items you can&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>
    - question: What is 4P's mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values and support small and mid-sized family farmers and
        artisans by giving them access to new markets, while also helping ensure
        that all people have equitable access to the Good Food produced by these
        farmers.</p><p>We believe that Good Food&mdash; food that is traceable,
        nutritious, accessible, and produced in a system that empowers farmers
        and sustains the environment&mdash; should be the norm, not the
        exception, and we actively work to make that vision a reality each and
        every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a growing network of
        small family farms and artisan producers in the region, but also
        advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the communities we
        serve.</p>
    - question: Is there a delivery fee?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Please note that delivery takes time and energy and an amazing
        delivery team. There is a fee of $8.95 for orders under $85 and $5.95
        for orders over $85. Since we are awesome humans (and not drones)
        delivering your food with care, hopefully you&rsquo;ll agree that
        it&rsquo;s totally worth it.</p><p>Delivery is free at <a
        href="https://4pfoods.com/posts/4p-foods-community-pickup-sites/">community
        pick-up sites</a>, where anyone can pick up their bags within a certain
        pick-up time frame to save C02 and save a few bucks.</p>
- title: Mission
  faqs:
    - question: How do I find out more about your farmers?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Check out our <a href="/farmers">Farmers page</a>! We&rsquo;re
        always updating it, so stay tuned for more profiles of the many amazing
        farmers, ranchers, and artisans from whom we source.</p>
    - question: What is 4P's mission?

        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And

        serve.</p>
    - question: How do you  address racial equity in the food system?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Right off the bat, we want to acknowledge that the food system has
        traditionally done a lot of harm to BIPOC communities, from colonization
        to slavery to the poor treatment of immigrant farm laborers. We are
        intentionally working to increase our sourcing from BIPOC farmers and to
        center equity in our daily work as a company. You can read more about
        racial injustice in the food system and 4P&rsquo;s response in this <a
        href="/posts/we-stand-with-all-of-you-we-stand-against-racism/">letter
        from our founder &amp; CEO</a>, Tom McDougall.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>The short answer: we source locally and regionally from a network of
        over 200 small, independent farmers, most of them located in the
        Mid-Atlantic. Does that mean it&rsquo;s &ldquo;local?&rdquo; That
        depends on where you live and how you define it, so we often use the
        term &ldquo;regional&rdquo; to describe our sourcing
        practices.</p><p>The longer answer: it depends on the item and the
        season. Avocados don&rsquo;t grow in the Mid-Atlantic, so we buy them
        from a fair-trade cooperative in Peru (read more about our sourcing of
        tropical items on our blog <a
        href="/posts/the-geography-of-good-food/">here</a>). As another example,
        we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their season
        up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond into
        mid-summer. 4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
        Collaborative, a network of other food hubs like us up and down the
        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Read our growing collection
        of <a href="/farmers">farmer profiles</a> for more information about
        our food.</p>
    - question: What do you mean by "Good Food"?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Here's how we define Good Food:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>provides nourishment
        and enables people to thrive.</li><li>is equitably accessible to
        everyone in our region, regardless of income, race, or zip
        code.</li><li>is produced in a manner that is environmentally
        regenerative.</li><li>comes from a supply chain in which every being is
        treated with respect and dignity.</li><li>improves health outcomes and
        economic security for all.</li></ol>
- title: Shopping
  faqs:
    - question: When can I customize my 4P Bags?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>On Saturdays, we update the 4P Bags and our online shop with
        what&rsquo;s fresh for the week. When the Weekly Harvest Newsletter hits
        your inbox, it means your bags are ready to customize! Our ETA is
        mid-day on Saturdays, but there are occasional delays due to mother
        nature or technology. The arrival of the newsletter alerts you that you
        have between then and your order deadline (<em>three days before your
        delivery day at 11:59 pm</em>) to customize your Bags and/or add a la
        carte items.</p>
    - question: How do I see what's coming in my next delivery?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>There are two ways to view your upcoming deliveries:</p><ol><li>From
        My Account &gt; Upcoming Deliveries: hover or click on My Account and
        select Upcoming Deliveries from the menu. On this page, you'll see the
        next six weeks of delivery days and any deliveries you have scheduled or
        skipped, as well as the option to skip, donate, or restore upcoming
        orders. Click the "Customize" button to see what you have coming in any
        bags.</li><li>From the cart: click on the bag icon in the upper right
        corner. You'll see the next six weeks of delivery days, with a number
        next to each date indicating how many items are in your bag that week.
        Click the "Customize" button to see what you have coming in any
        bags.</li></ol>
    - question: How do I know if my order is “done”?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>There&rsquo;s no checkout button on your shopping cart. As long as
        you hit the $30 order minimum, you&rsquo;re good to
        go.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there <em>is</em> a &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button
        you need to click to finish the customizing process for a 4P bag. If
        you&rsquo;re here from our old site, that&rsquo;s an important change to
        note!</p><p>Whenever you make changes to your order (including adding or
        removing items or customizing a bag), you&rsquo;ll get a confirmation
        email. When you change a recurring order, you&rsquo;ll get emails for
        the future deliveries, as well. If you don&rsquo;t want to get a
        confirmation email every time, you can hit &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; at
        the bottom of the email to update your email preferences for different
        types of emails.</p>
    - question: When is the order deadline each week?
      answer_html: >-
        <p><strong>The deadline to make any customizations to your 4P order is a
        full 48 hours before your delivery day. </strong>Please be mindful of
        this cut-off which gives us a chance to finalize orders with farmers and
        artisans! The order deadline by delivery day is as
        follows:</p><ul><li>11:59 pm on Sunday for a Wednesday
        delivery</li><li>11:59 pm on Monday for a Thursday
        delivery</li><li>11:59 pm on Tuesday for a Friday delivery</li></ul>
    - question: How do I skip an order, or multiple orders at once?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>To skip once, login to your account and click on &ldquo;My
        Account&rdquo; in the upper right hand corner and then click on
        &ldquo;Upcoming Deliveries.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll see the orders you have
        scheduled for the next six weeks, including the items and total cost,
        and you&rsquo;ll also see buttons that allow you to skip or donate each
        individual order.</p><p>If you choose to skip, you won&rsquo;t be
        charged for your order that week. If you choose to donate, you will be
        charged, and your order will be packed up and delivered to one of our
        food assistance partners, like the <a
        href="/posts/fauquier-community-food-bank/">Fauquier Community Food
        Bank</a>.</p><p>You can skip for a longer period of time by turning on a
        Vacation Hold. Under &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; click on &ldquo;Delivery
        Hold&rdquo; and enter your vacation dates - we will skip all deliveries
        scheduled that fall between the date you entered to leave and the date
        you entered to return.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need any assistance skipping a
        delivery, please <a href="/contact/">reach out to us</a> and we'll be
        happy to help.</p>
    - question: I only want to order a small amount of dairy or protein--can I do that?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Select dairy and protein items can be purchased a la carte, including
        eggs and butter. Take a look through the Dairy &amp; Eggs and Protein
        sections of the shop to see what is available to add to your
        cart.&nbsp;</p><p>Dairy and protein bags have $20 minimums, so if you
        customize one of those bags to be less than $20 worth of products,
        you&rsquo;ll still be charged $20. With a wide and ever-growing
        selection of products and flexible order frequencies (one-time, every
        week, every other week, monthly), $20 shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to
        hit!</p><p>To access our full rotating inventory for Dairy (including
        our selection of cheese), shop for a Dairy Bag and customize what's
        inside!</p>
    - question: How can I tell what’s in my bag while I’m customizing?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>From the shop, click on &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Inside&rdquo; on any bag
        image to see what&rsquo;s available for a given week (if there are
        multiple weeks available, you can switch between them in the dropdown
        list at the top). Any items highlighted in pale yellow are what&rsquo;s
        coming in the standard bag that week.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve added a
        bag to your cart, click &ldquo;Customize&rdquo; to go to the Customize
        page (you can also navigate there from the &ldquo;Upcoming
        Deliveries&rdquo; page under &ldquo;My Account.&rdquo;) Bags will be
        pre-packed with the 4P Picks for the Week, which will show up in yellow
        with a green checkmark at the top of the product list. Products you
        remove will uncheck and change from yellow to white, and products you
        add will check and change from white to yellow. You can see a summary of
        your bag in the list in the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Inside&rdquo; section on
        the right in desktop view or at the top in mobile view.</p>
    - question: I’m here from your old site—where did the points go?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We did away with the points system in favor of a setup that requires
        a little less math and offers a lot more flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>To get
        started, click the shopping bag icon in the upper right and then click
        &ldquo;Customize.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>For produce and fruit bags, you
        simply swap items one for one. Use the +/- buttons to change the
        quantity of each item in the full product list, or click the red
        &ldquo;x&rdquo; next to an item in the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Inside&rdquo;
        section to remove it. Keep an eye on the &ldquo;Items Left to Add&rdquo;
        box in that section (on the right side of your screen in desktop view or
        the top of your screen in mobile view) to know how much room is left in
        your bag. If you need more items that can fit in your bag, you can now
        add a la carte produce (and pantry, protein, and dairy!) items as needed
        once you&rsquo;re done customizing.&nbsp;</p><p>For protein and dairy
        bags, the sky&rsquo;s the limit! From the Customize page, you can add
        and subtract to your heart&rsquo;s content, but both bags have a minimum
        price of $20, so be sure to put at least that much in your bag (while
        you&rsquo;re customizing, you can see your running total in the
        &ldquo;Bag Price&rdquo; field in the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Inside&rdquo;
        section on the right side of your screen in desktop view or the top of
        your screen in mobile view).</p>
    - question: >-
        It takes me a long time to scroll through all of the options while I’m
        customizing. Is there a quicker way to find what I want?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Sure is! On the Customize page, click on the product categories under
        &ldquo;Customize Bag Contents&rdquo; to jump to that type of product
        (i.e. &ldquo;Fruits&rdquo; in the produce bag or &ldquo;Beef&rdquo; in
        the protein bag).</p>
    - question: >-
        I used to get pantry items in my produce bag, but now I don’t see them
        available as swaps. Where did the pantry items go?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Most pantry items have changed from bag items to a la carte items,
        meaning you can add them on to any order, no saving up points required.
        Click &ldquo;Pantry&rdquo; in the navigation bar at the top of the shop
        to see the full selection.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t need as many produce
        items as come in a produce bag in addition to your pantry items,
        we&rsquo;ve got you covered! Build a fully a la carte order by selecting
        exactly the individual items that you want from each category--anything
        that can be added to your cart from the shop is available a la carte. As
        long as you hit the $30 minimum order, you&rsquo;re good to go, no
        Produce, Protein, or Dairy Bag required.</p>

  faqs:
    - question: How does delivery work?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>All of our deliveries are contactless, and you should receive an
        automatic email or text notification when a driver drops off your
        bags.</p><p>In general, if you signed up for direct home delivery, we
        usually deliver the bags right to your doorstep, or wherever you
        indicated in your delivery instructions (if we don&rsquo;t deliver to
        the right place, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>&nbsp;to let
        us know!).</p><p>For commercial buildings or apartment complexes, we
        deliver the bags per the building&rsquo;s COVID-19 protocols and your
        directions. Per our own COVID-19 protocols, all of our drivers wear
        required face masks and gloves--read more about our response to the
        pandemic <a href="/posts/covid-19-response/">here</a>. If your building
        has limited open hours for deliveries as a result of COVID-19, please <a
        href="/contact/">let us know</a> so we can plan accordingly.</p><p>In an
        effort to maximize delivery efficiency and minimize contact during the
        busiest hours of the day, your delivery may arrive as early as 4:00AM
        and as late as 8:00PM. You will have the opportunity to tell us your
        delivery time preferences during registration, or you can <a

        limitations.</p>
    - question: Is there a delivery fee?

        frame to save C02 and save a few bucks.</p>
    - question: What are Community Pick-up Sites and how can I join?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We've teamed up with select community centers and local businesses to
        be pickup points for 4P deliveries. Having your bags dropped off to a
        pick-up site helps us curb CO2 and helps you save money, as we'll waive
        the delivery fee on all orders!</p><p>New customers can choose a
        Community Pickup Site as your delivery location while registering, and
        anyone can change their delivery location to a 4P Community Pick-up Site
        (or vis versa) from your 4P account. To see if there are any sites near
        you, simply log in to your account, click "Account Info," and navigate
        to the dropdown below &ldquo;Do you want Pickup or Delivery?&rsquo; for
        a list of participating locations. Just note that you'll need to be able
        to pickup your bags during their business hours. Don't see a pick-up

        you!</p>
    - question: Will the food stay fresh after it is delivered?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>You will receive an email or text notification when a driver drops
        off your bags. We deliver our food in insulated packaging to keep
        everything cold. We'd recommend picking up and unpacking your bags as
        soon as you can, but as long as you can do so within a few hours (or
        longer in cooler weather), you should be fine. We take all the packaging
        back to sanitize and reuse, so please set out your empties on delivery
        day for our driver to swap out.</p>
    - question: What if something in my delivery is missing or damaged?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>If you receive any disappointing items, or if anything is missing,
        please let us know! We&rsquo;ll gladly try to correct whatever happened,
        whether through a credit or an extra item in your next
        delivery.</p><p>We do our best to closely manage inventory so that we
        have enough for all orders but not so much that anything goes to waste.
        If we ever run out of an item or it becomes unavailable after you have
        placed your order, we'll do our best to notify you in advance so you can
        let us know what you&rsquo;d like instead. If we're unable get in touch
        in time, we&rsquo;ll issue you a credit for the missing item (or send
        you a substitute item in select circumstances, i.e. pack gala apples as
        a substitute for stayman apples, if out of stock).</p>

  faqs:
    - question: How are you different than other online food delivery services?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We bring the freshest, highest-quality produce, meat, dairy, and
        pantry goods right to your doorstep from farmers and producers in the
        Mid-Atlantic region (and <a
        href="/posts/whats-in-the-winter-bag/">sometimes beyond</a>) who <a
        href="/posts/good-food-knows-no-boundaries/">share our values of Good
        Food</a>. With 4P, you are voting with your fork for a <a
        href="/our-impact/">more sustainable and equitable</a> food system for
        everyone.</p><p>Our produce offerings vary with the seasons. In the
        Spring, you&rsquo;ll see asparagus and strawberries. In the summer,
        tomatoes and sweet corn. Autumn equals apples and leafy greens. And in
        the Winter, it&rsquo;s a mix of local greenhouse-grown produce like
        lettuce and storage crops like butternut squash, artisan goods from
        local makers, and fruits and vegetables from farmers further
        south.&nbsp;</p><p>Year-round, we offer great local meats and dairy from
        animals raised on open pasture and treated with dignity throughout their
        lives, as well as delicious pantry goods like pastas, jams, and more
        made by local artisans. We also aim to curb waste by packaging food in
        eco-friendly totes that are returned and reused.</p>
    - question: Where do you source your food from?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>The short answer: we source locally and regionally from a network of
        over 200 small, independent farmers, most of them located in the
        Mid-Atlantic. Does that mean it&rsquo;s &ldquo;local?&rdquo; That
        depends on where you live and how you define it, so we often use the
        term &ldquo;regional&rdquo; to describe our sourcing
        practices.</p><p>The longer answer: it depends on the item and the
        season. Avocados don&rsquo;t grow in the Mid-Atlantic, so we buy them
        from a fair-trade cooperative in Peru (read more about our sourcing of
        tropical items on our blog <a
        href="/posts/the-geography-of-good-food/">here</a>). As another example,
        we can offer peak-season strawberries longer by following their season
        up from the Carolinas in early spring through Virginia and beyond into
        mid-summer. 4P is a founding member of the Eastern Food Hub
        Collaborative, a network of other food hubs like us up and down the
        Eastern Seaboard who all work with their own vetted networks of small,
        sustainable farmers and work together to increase the variety and supply
        of produce available from this region.</p><p>Read our growing collection
        of <a href="/farmers">farmer profiles</a> for more information about
        our food and the people behind it.</p>
    - question: Is all the food organic? What about non-GMO?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Some of it is USDA-certified organic, and some of it is not (not all
        farmers who use organic practices choose to get certified). While
        certifications are certainly important, what is most important to us
        is&nbsp;<a href="/posts/good-food-knows-no-boundaries/">Good
        Food</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Good Food provides nourishment and enables
        people to thrive, is equitably accessible to everyone in the region, is
        produced in a manner that is environmentally regenerative, comes from a
        supply chain in which every being is treated with respect and dignity,
        and improves health outcomes and economic security for
        all.</p></blockquote><p>We work with farmers who are good stewards of
        their resources, including land, water, and labor. Our&nbsp;<a
        href="/farmers">farmer profiles</a>&nbsp;are a great place to get
        more information about each farmer and their growing practices. While we
        embrace a local and regional food system, you can choose to&nbsp;<a
        href="/how-to-shop/">customize</a>&nbsp;your bags to include only local
        products, for example.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to be 100% supporting
        regenerative agriculture. Regenerative agriculture seeks not only to
        maintain but also to increase soil health, carbon sequestration, and
        biodiversity.</p>
    - question: What is 4P's Mission?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>Our mission is to empower you to transform the food system.</p><p>And
        how do we do that, you ask? Every purchase you make with 4P allows you
        to live your values via a short, transparent supply chain and to know
        that you are supporting a company seeking far more than profit (in fact,
        the 4P's are an expansion of the idea of the triple bottom line: People,
        Planet, Prosperity, and Purpose). Everything we do aims to help small
        and mid-sized family farmers and artisans not just to survive, but to
        thrive, while also helping ensure that all people have equitable access
        to the Good Food produced by these farmers.</p><p>We believe that Good
        Food&mdash; food that is traceable, nutritious, accessible, and produced
        in a system that empowers farmers and sustains the environment&mdash;
        should be the norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that
        vision a reality each and every day. Every purchase with 4P not only
        supports a growing network of small family farms and artisan producers
        in the region, but also advances equitable access to fresh healthy food
        in the communities we serve.</p>
    - question: How can I order extra items?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>After you choose your bag(s), head over to the shop to browse that
        week&rsquo;s available items and add anything you would like. You can
        choose if you want this item just one time, or on a recurring basis
        (based on availability).&nbsp;</p><p>Can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re
        looking for? Try clicking the magnifying glass in the corner to search
        for a specific item.</p>
    - question: What should I do with the old bags?
      answer_html: >-
        <p>We carefully inspect, sanitize, and reuse them, so we would love to
        have them back! To help minimize both cost and waste, please return the
        old bags, cooler boxes (tote bag, cooler packs, and insulated box
        included), and any glass milk bottles to the same place where your bags
        were dropped off. We&rsquo;ll send you a reminder email the day before
        your delivery so that our driver can pick them when they deliver the
        next day. We&rsquo;ll then sanitize them for reuse. With your help,
        it&rsquo;s a win-win! Thank you!</p>
