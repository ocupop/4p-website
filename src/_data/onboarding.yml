      - title: How to Customize Produce and Fruit Bags
        description_html: >-
          <p>Produce and new fruit bags have a set price and number of items
          within each size. Swap out any item you don't want from our weekly
          picks and then swap in any item you do, one for one. Wondering where a
          favorite pantry item has gone? If it's not a swap in the bag, you can
          buy it a la carte&amp;mdash;look for it by category or in the search
          bar.</p>
