<div class="editable"><p>We at 4P Foods want to wish you a happy and healthy New Year!&nbsp;</p><p>The year 2020 has been extremely challenging for so many, as COVID-19 harmed the most vulnerable in our communities, and we as a nation raised together to address racial reckoning across the country. As we all reflect on the triumphs and losses of the past year, and look ahead to bringing more structural changes in 2021, we do wish to pause in reflection on the resilience of our local food system and its ability to feed our local communities.&nbsp;</p><p>At the start of the year, we moved into our new xxxx square foot warehouse next to ours with big plans to grow to utilize the space. Little did we know, in a few short months we would not only fill the existing xxx coolers and dry storage, but our operations would expand beyond refrigerated trucks in our parking lot, plus an additional xxx foot warehouse for emergency food relief storage, as our direct delivery services became critical and our business pivoted in the face of the pandemic. Within two months of moving in, over x,xxx members had joined 4P Foods for direct doorstep delivery and our small team grew by 60 employees, and at times, held our breath if the business could remain open due to the COVID closures.</p><p>We constantly strive to lead with purpose&mdash;to advance our mission of ensuring that all people can eat Good Food and all farmers can make a living growing Good Food. Our vision of the Good Food system of the future is bold, some might even say audacious (our Food Net Vision was one of 72 semi-finalists in the Rockefeller Foundation&rsquo;s Food System Vision Prize). While there is certainly a long road ahead, with your support, we are making progress each and every day, as evidenced by these top five highlights of 2020:</p><h2><img src="/uploads/browntownfarms-herbert.jpg" width="427" height="427" /></h2><h2><strong>Spent nearly $3M with independent Virginia farmers</strong></h2><p>Since our <a href="https://4pfoods.com/about">start-up beginnings</a> in 2014, sourcing food from local and sustainable family farms has been our priority. With your support, 4P Foods tripled its purchasing from local, small- and mid-sized farmers in 2020. When you spend your grocery dollars with 4P, 60 cents of every dollar is returned to the farmer, as compared to 14.5 cents per dollar at the conventional big box stores. In 2020, 4P sourced from 120 local farmers and producers. We brought on many new producers in 2020, including Herbert Brown of Browntown Farms in Warfield, VA. You may have had his cherry tomatoes over the summer, and you can find his amazing <a href="https://shop.4pfoods.com/summary.php?go=products&amp;search_substring=browntown">strawberry jams</a> in our Pantry section. Together we are making an investment in the hard-working farmers, the independent local businesses, and the precious land and natural resources that fed us through this crisis and, with our continued support, will feed and nourish our communities for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[</strong><a href="https://4pfoods.com/our-farmers"><strong>Meet Our Farmers</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><img src="/uploads/2020-05-08-4pfoods-hv-1080-36-1.jpg" width="428" height="360" /></h2><h2><strong>Moved over 50,000 lbs of donated or rescued food to dozens of community organizations across DC/MD/VA for MAFRAC</strong></h2><p>When 4P Foods Founder &amp; CEO, Tom McDougall, found himself at the National Good Food Network conference in New Orleans in mid-March, surrounded by other food system stakeholders grappling with the impending crisis, very little was clear other than that COVID-19 was going to challenge the food system like nothing before. Seeking to build upon the strength of the deep roots and many interwoven branches of the local food system, 4P Foods co-founded the Mid-Atlantic Food Resilience and Access Coalition (MAFRAC) to coordinate regional efforts to <a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/05/11/local-coalition-turns-excess-farmers-food-into-an-opportunity-to-feed-hungry-people/">keep people fed, farmers growing, and small food businesses operating</a>. To date, MAFRAC has distributed over 85,000 pounds of donated or rescued food (including over 50,000 pounds of which was done by 4P drivers in 4P trucks) and used a participatory grantmaking process to give over $750,000 in funds to 78 food assistance organizations to buy food from local producers to give away. That's money that went back into the local food system to support local farmers and food businesses, while getting Good Food to those in need.</p><p>Beyond the pounds of food distributed and dollars granted, MAFRAC&rsquo;s intangible impacts, in connections, knowledge, and relationships between the hundreds of stakeholders in its network, will continue to strengthen the food system long beyond the pandemic. MAFRAC will continue its work of connecting people, food, farms, and funds as long as there is a need. If you are in a position to give, please consider making a tax-deductible <a href="https://secure.donationpay.org/mafrac/">donation to MAFRAC</a> today.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/07/pandemic-could-strengthen-us-food-system/"><strong>Learn More</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><img src="/uploads/2020-06-24-va-warenton-communitycooks-dj-doherty-herd-ventures-16-540x.jpg" width="427" height="357" /></h2><h2><strong>Distributed over 10,000 meals in partnership with Community Cooks</strong></h2><p>On a blustery spring day in late March, 4P distributed 500 locally sourced, pay-what-you-can taco meals with the help of Fauquier Community Child Care (FCCC), and from this first <a href="https://www.fauquier.com/news/4p-foods-hosts-taco-tuesday-in-warrenton-march-24/article_adb03fec-6d21-11ea-a4dd-173e26078404.html">Taco Tuesday</a>, an ongoing grab-and-go lunch program was born. Intended to address the gaps in existing nutrition programs and feed the most vulnerable in Fauquier County, the home of our food hub headquarters, this program distributed 4,975 meals, all sourced from local small farmers and businesses, during its first two months. 4P then joined forces with chef Venus Barratt of the Warrenton Wellness Kitchen, who started Community Cooks out of a desire to bolster the local restaurant community and to use her tiny but mighty kitchen and team of dedicated volunteers to ensure everyone had access to healthy food. With support from MAFRAC and the PATH Foundation, <a href="https://bit.ly/3mJ9Swy">Community Cooks</a>&nbsp; sourced local ingredients from 4P and paid local restaurants to turn them into meals that were distributed by 4P trucks and FCCC volunteers, who provided not just food, but a sense of community and authentic care for the people they served. Community Cooks provided another 6,230 meals from May through August. Together with our community partners, generous donors, and support of members like you, 4P was among the many who acted to ease the burdens of the pandemic.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/07/pandemic-could-strengthen-us-food-system/"><strong>Learn More</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><img src="/uploads/2020-07-01-dc-ward7-foodequitycampaign-spacesinaction-10.jpg" width="425" height="331" /></h2><h2><strong>Delivered over 25,000 bags to community partners who share our vision of making Good Food the norm, not the exception</strong></h2><p>You might not expect a neighborhood&nbsp; gym or an advocacy organization to host food distributions, but in 2020, 4P partnered with these and other diverse community organizations to increase food access in their communities. As a food hub, we have always activated our infrastructure and operations team to connect people to fresh food from our farm network. In 2020, we doubled down on our mission to ensure that all people have access to Good Food, just as many businesses and organizations pivoted their operations in order to support their communities through the pandemic. For example, with the support of the MAFRAC network and a MAFRAC grant, Leila Bournes of <a href="__notset__">Bourne 2 Fly Fitness in DC began holding </a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/B2FFitness/posts/3784634521602050">regular events</a> at which community members could pick up produce bags from 4P and wellness bags stocked with cleaning and personal care items. [example - spotlight emergency feeding organizations] Together with Leila and many other partners, 4P helped deliver over 25,000 bags of food to those in need in 2020.</p><p>Many of those bags were distributed through a program run by Local Food Hub, a longtime partner of 4P Foods. In 2020, <a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/fresh-farmacy-fruit-and-veggie-prescription-program/">Local Food Hub&rsquo;s Fresh Farmacy Program</a> more than doubled it's reach to serve 650 families every week.&nbsp; Fresh Farmacy provides bags of fresh produce to Charlottesville-area residents who have limited access to healthy foods and suffer from diet-related illnesses. 4P has a dedicated sourcing program for Fresh Farmacy, allowing us to work with farmers who may not (yet) be a good fit for our core sourcing, either because they&rsquo;re new to wholesale or very small-scale. This program was critical for those in need of healthy food, and for emerging farmers who saw who saw Fresh Farmacy purchases grow by as much as twenty times during a year when traditional markets were turned upside down. We are grateful for the commitment of every partner and the 4P team working tirelessly to make Good Food accessible to all people, no matter their age, zip code, or income.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a href="https://4pfoods.com/our-partners"><strong>Meet Our Partners</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><img src="/uploads/2020-06-17-va-hanover-agriberryfarm-danieljames-herd-ventures-13-540x.jpg" width="427" height="360" /></h2><h2><strong>Created community with 4P Virtual Tours with 11 farm and community partners</strong></h2><p>Food and community go together like peanut butter and jelly, eggs and bacon, berries and cream... You get the picture! So how do you create community around food when you can&rsquo;t be physically present and break bread together? In lieu of our annual Earth Day Birthday celebration (which traditionally marks the start of spring and the anniversary of 4P&rsquo;s founding in April of 2014), we forged a new path to building community and connection with our mini-series: 4P Virtual Tours. Throughout the spring, 4P broadcasted everywhere from farm fields to cheese caves on Facebook Live as we sought to share with you some of the stories behind 4P&rsquo;s food, mission, and partners. Thanks to some editing magic and the seven willing partners who welcomed the 4P community behind the scenes, you can find condensed versions of the tours on our YouTube channel. In this mini series, you'll get introduced to MountainView Farm, a woman-owned artisan cheesemaker regularly featured in our Dairy Bag; Together We Bake,&nbsp; a mission-based bakery and non-profit providing job and life skills; Dreaming Out Loud, a dynamic food justice organization and operating food hub in DC; and more<em>.</em> Watch the tours for the first time or share with friends and family.</p><p class="AlignCenter"><strong>[</strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLclGq72kjEo30AL70jmFH5nwV1HAS9jcC"><strong>Take Tour</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p></div>
