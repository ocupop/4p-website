Our network is a local and regional network of independent growers for fresh, healthy food year-round. Local is our priority but our button line is sustainably produced food that shares our Good Food values:</p><blockquote><p>Good Food provides nourishment and enables people to thrive, is equitably accessible to everyone in the region, is produced in a manner that is environmentally regenerative, comes from a supply chain in which every being is treated with respect and dignity, and improves health outcomes and economic security for all.</p></blockquote><p><strong>DELIVERY: </strong>Choose direct doorstep delivery or to pick-up from a partnering community pick-up site.</p><p><strong>PICK-UP:</strong> Save C02 and money each week by opting to pick-up from a participating 4P community site.</p><p><strong>4P BAGS: </strong>Each week we send you a list of a fresh selection of produce, dairy, and meat items. Do nothing and receive our curated selection or customize your 4P Bag.</p><p><strong>RECURRING ORDERS: </strong>Want the Produce Bag weekly? Need the Meat Bag or 1 dozen eggs just every other week? Select the recurring delivery setting for each 4P Bag or item. (options are weekly, every other week, or monthly).

We&rsquo;re flexible, just note that the deadline to make changes is a full 2-days prior to your delivery day.</p><p><strong>VACATION HOLD: </strong>Going out of town? Place a vacation hold to skip your order for a longer period of time. We&rsquo;ll be here to fill your fridge when you get back.</p><p><strong>DONATIONS: </strong>Skipping your order?
