Many of us hold tight to our families' holiday traditions, especially when it comes to food. In December we asked you to share your ultimate cozy comfort food or best holiday-inspired dish. The winner of December's 4P Foodies recipe contest is the hearty and flavorful <em>Pumpkin Spice Pasta</em> by 4P member, Mike K. from Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3><div>Virginia Bison Co. Bison Bourbon Fennel Sausage (or mild/sweet sausage of your choice)</div><div>White onion</div><div>Cooking oil</div><div>Pasta of your choice</div><div>Salt&nbsp;</div><div>8 oz (half a can) of pureed&nbsp;</div><div>8 oz Milk&nbsp;</div><div>Ground nutmeg</div><div>Ground ground clove</div><div>Ground cinnamon</div><div>ground ginger</div><div>Ground onion powder</div><div>&nbsp;Garlic powder&nbsp;</div><div>Ground Gochugaru</div><div>Asparagus</div><div>Grated parmigiano reggiano&nbsp;</div><div>Toasted nuts (for garnish)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3><p>Start some generously salted water boiling in a pot. Saute 0.5-0.75 lb of loose mild or sweet sausage of your choice and about a third of a white onion (roughly chopped) until the onion is soft and meat is cooked or browned to your liking. Remove from the pan and discard excess oil. I used bison bourbon fennel sausage. In an empty pan, add asparagus cut into 1.5" segments, along with oil if necessary. Saute until finished and remove from the pan. Meanwhile, add a pasta of your choice to the water and continue to boil. Short pasta (e.g. ziti) works best, but any will do. Boil until done. Put about 8 oz (half a can) of pureed to the pan, now on medium. Once warm, add about 8 oz milk (I used whole milk) and stir until mixed. Bring to a simmer. Add your pumpkin spices to taste. I used freshly ground nutmeg, ground clove, cinnamon, and ginger, along with salt, onion powder, garlic powder and gochugaru. Continue simmering until desired sauce thickness is achieved. Remember, it will tighten as it cools. Once sauce is done, add sausage mixture, asparagus, grated parmigiano reggiano, and pasta, and toss until homogeneous. Spoon into a wide bowl and sprinkle with roughly chopped toasted hazelnuts or pistachios. Enjoy!</p></div>
