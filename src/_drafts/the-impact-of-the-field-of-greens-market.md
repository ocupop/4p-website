The Field of Greens Market is the only year-round farmers market within those communities. Thanks to donations, the Field of Greens Market has been able to continue operating and delivering food in the communities next to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nats4good.org/youth-baseball-academy?utm_source=4P+Foodies&amp;utm_campaign=d31f018384-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_30_05_11&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_838d40fd2e-d31f018384-">Nationals Youth Baseball Academy.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few ways that the Market has made an impact:</p><ul><li><strong>Over 2,100 bags</strong> distributed from the Field of Greens Market this year</li><li><strong>80% </strong>of community members who participate in the market say it is<strong> &ldquo;the most conveniently located option to secure fresh produce&rdquo;</strong> and 50% of participants report it is the only source of fresh produce convenient to their home</li><li><strong>90%</strong> of surveyed residents who participate in the market say that they consume<strong> less fast food and have a healthier diet</strong> thanks to the market</li></ul><p>4P Foods&rsquo; partnership with Nationals Youth Baseball Academy started back in 2018. 4P not only provides nutrient-dense, locally-sourced food to the Field of Greens Market, we also provided food for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ymcadc.org/cooking-classes/">YMCA of Metropolitan Washington Food Programs</a>&rsquo; health and community inspired cooking classes. Before the pandemic, teachers from the YMCA Food Programs would hold classes for nutritious meal planning in the teaching kitchen at the Academy, often with food sourced from 4P Foods.</p><p>The demand for accessible and affordable food continues to increase. As many as 90 bags per week are required to fulfill requests from community residents. A contribution of only $30 a month can provide enough fruits and vegetables for one week for a family of four. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shop.4pfoods.com/donate">Add a donation bag to your 4P Foods order today!</a></p><p>Read more:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/posts/field-of-greens-affordable-csa-style-market-held-at-the-nats-academy/">About the start of the program.</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/posts/the-washington-nationals-youth-baseball-academy-and-4p-foods-invite-the-public-to-participate-in-buy-a-bag-program/">About sustaining the weekly farmers market.</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/posts/nats4good-community-grant/">About the Nats4Good community grant.</a></p><p>See news about the Market:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wtop.com/dc/2021/04/baseball-and-veggies-served-at-nats-youth-baseball-academy-in-ward-7/">WTOP News</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/sports/mlb/nationals-youth-academy-hosts-a-field-of-greens/65-b9d6a7f5-6310-4ef3-8e9b-2ec4fa462a03">WUSA9</a></p></div>
