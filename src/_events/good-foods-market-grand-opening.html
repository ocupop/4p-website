          <p>A Grand Opening ribbon-cutting celebration is scheduled for 11:30 am on Saturday, November&nbsp; 13.

          <p>Good Food Markets offers fresh produce, essential groceries and freshly made prepared food,&nbsp; and it will house a dining room as well as a community room for meetings. A full-service cafe at&nbsp; the Bellevue store will begin operating in the new year. When the cafe opens, total employment&nbsp; for the store is estimated at 15 people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The store will also host health education events for adults and children, and partner with&nbsp; community organizations to provide residents with tools to stay healthy. Other Good Food&nbsp; Markets locations have hosted more than 400 such programs since 2015. Throughout the&nbsp; pandemic, Good Food Markets has provided emergency food to nonprofits and delivered more&nbsp; than 540,000 meals worth of groceries in DC, Maryland, and Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Good Food Markets in Ward 8 is the collective effort of more than 30 individuals and&nbsp; organizations over the past five years,&rdquo; said Philip Sambol, Good Food Markets&rsquo; executive&nbsp; director. &ldquo;All have contributed to a food access vision beyond just fresh produce and healthy&nbsp; food. With the meeting room, caf&eacute;, and a wealth of organizations active in the neighborhood,&nbsp; Good Food Markets can become a space to gather, share and contribute to the community.&rdquo;</p>
