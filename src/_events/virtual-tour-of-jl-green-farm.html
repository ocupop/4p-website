  Farm with farmers Jordan and Laura Green to find out! 


  J & L Green Farm his a grass-based sustainable farm and one of the largest
  outdoor pasture-based farrow to finish farms in the state of Virginia. Tune in
  to see the 200-acre farm in Edinburg, Virginia and hear what makes their pork
  so special. J & L is a partnering farm and source of pastured and forested
  pork and grass-fed beef in our rotating selection of pasture-raised, non-gmo,
  meat.
