          <p>Get to know the story behind your food with 4P Foods Virtual Tours! Meet Anne Geyer, farmer and owner of Agriberry Farm &amp; CSA to learn the juicy details behind the family-owned and operated, berry farm that produces delicious raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, plums, cherries, and more. We met with Anne on a rainy spring day in April, where she shared what&rsquo;s in season, what to expect in your 4P bags, and how Agriberry embraces the community-supported agriculture model. In addition to providing fruit to 4P Foodies, local restaurants, Agriberry Farm has its own CSA program, workforce training for aspiring farmers, and preserves fruit into jellies and jams available at the farm store.</p>
