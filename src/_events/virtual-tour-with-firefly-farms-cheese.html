          <p>Get to know the stories behind the food. Our Virtual Tour with Firefly Farms Cheese is a great opportunity to visit the award-winning artisan cheesemakers. Firefly Farms founder and CEO, Michael Koch as well as head cheesemaker, Dan Porter shares some secrets behind cheesemaking and aging goats cheese in this socially distanced tour.</p>
          <p>Founded in 2002 by partners Mike Koch &amp; Pablo Solanet, FireFly Farms is proudly dedicated and committed to excellence in sustainably crafted, reliably fresh goat cheese. Fresh goat milk is sourced from family farms within 30-miles of the creamery, and is free from antibiotics, hormones, and then traditionally crafted with only four simple ingredients.
