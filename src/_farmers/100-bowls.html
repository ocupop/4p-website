    When Katharine Mardirosian was living with her mother-in-law in Romania, she was inspired by how every meal was
    cooked from scratch. The whole chicken was cooked down into broth and ingredients from a modest pantry were sliced
    and simmered into incredibly delicious soups. After tasting the nourishing flavors of from-scratch soups and
    wholesome broths, Katharine vowed never to go back to cooking with the dehydrated flavors found in boxed bouillon or
    cans. In 2009, Katharine founded 100 Bowls of Soup, an artisan soup and broth company with the mission to create
    flavorful and nourishing soups and broths with the practical and sustainable cooking methods that have been
    passed-down from generation to generation in kitchens across the world.

    Each bowl begins with fresh, healthy, and locally sourced ingredients. 100 Bowls of Soup sources main ingredients
    from local and organic farms to create seasonally inspired soups and broths. On the menu are a selection of meat
    broths, including Beef, Bison, Chicken, and Turkey Bone Broth, and seasonal vegan soups. In the fall and winter
    months, the soup menu expands to include hearty meat stews, sauces, and chili. All 100 Bowls products are gluten
    free, dairy free, and low sodium. The recipes focus on hearty natural flavors from the ingredients themselves, using
    citrus and spices with little or often no added salt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Available now with our Protein Bag is 100 Bowls Chicken Bone Broth, which is packaged in 28oz quart containers and
    frozen until ready to consume. The broth is made with pasture-raised chicken from Polyface Farm, Whiffletree Farm,
    or J&amp;L Green Farm &ndash; all of which are partnering farms at 4P Foods. Katharine&rsquo;s kitchen philosophy is
    to use the whole vegetable and the whole animal, (or in the example of chicken broth, the whole leftover parts
    consumers aren&rsquo;t buying from the farm!). Enjoy 100 Bowls broth as a base to any soup, turning leftover veggies
    from your 4P Produce Bag into a quick and tasty, home-made meal.

  <h4><strong>KATHARINE&rsquo;S KITCHEN TIPS FOR 100 BOWLS BROTHS:</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Heat and sip for nourishing warm beverage. Garnish with a squeeze of lemon juice, a fresh slice of ginger,
      cilantro leaves, or your favorite aromatic herbs.
    </li>
    <li>Sautee with dark, hearty greens for added moisture and flavor.</li>
    <li>Use in place of water when cooking grains.</li>
    <li>Makes an excellent base for stews, sauces, and gravies.</li>
    <li>
      Heat in pot as the base to any soup! Add leftover roasted roots or simmer with on-hand chopped veggies for a quick
      meal. Pro tip: Add noodles and top with soft boiled egg or sliced grass-fed beef, and top with your favorite ramen
      accents.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Bone broth will keep for six months in the freezer. Once defrosted, broth is best consumed within four to six days.
    100 Bowls recommends refreezing extra broth within the four to six day period only. Currently in stock are 100 Bowls
    Chicken Bone Broth and soon we will introduce seasonal soups. Tell us what you think and what you would like to see
    more of!
