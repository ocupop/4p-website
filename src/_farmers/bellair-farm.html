          <p>A working farm since the 1700s, Bellair Farm has deep ties to the local community and a rich agricultural history. Today, the farm is owned by Cynthia Davis and managed by Jamie Barrett, a Pennsylvania native with more than ten years of farming experience.</p>
          <p>Together, Cynthia and Jamie have created something of a farm lover's paradise &ndash; acres of lush green fruits and vegetables line the fields, a pick-your-own patch of flowers and herbs beckon families to linger on Saturday afternoons, an array of solar panels tucked behind the greenhouse captures energy to power surrounding buildings.</p>
          <p>In addition to selling to 4P Foods and Local Food Hub, you can find their produce at Charlottesville area farmers&rsquo; markets and through their CSA program. Bellair&rsquo;s produce has always been grown using organic methods, and the farm recently achieved USDA organic certification.</p>
          <p>Bellair Farm is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
