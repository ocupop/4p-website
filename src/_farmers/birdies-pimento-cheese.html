          <p>To the uninitiated, pimento cheese might seem like an odd combination: cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, and pimento peppers, sometimes with additions like cream cheese, hot sauce, onions, or garlic. But one taste of this piquant, creamy spread from South Hill, Virginia-based Birdie&rsquo;s Pimento Cheese will convert anyone into a pimento cheese fan. It could be the high-quality ingredients, the unique flavors, or the way each tub is carefully handcrafted, but most of all it&rsquo;s probably the passion of Birdie&rsquo;s founder, Robin Allen.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Robin has nurtured a lifelong love of pimento cheese. Growing up, she took for granted the ever-present tub in the fridge, which she would sneak spoonfuls from throughout the day. It didn&rsquo;t factor into her professional aspirations, though, until she and her husband, Glenn, got the itch to try something new after 25 years of co-running a successful printing business. A farmers market had recently opened in their hometown of South Hill, a small town in southern Virginia, and Robin and Glenn thought they would try their hand at a single day of selling their pimento cheese at the market. Needless to say, that market was a wild success, and Robin and Glenn had so much fun that they decided to sell their printing business and turn their pimento cheese passion into a full-time business.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Birdie&rsquo;s approaches this Southern classic with a curiosity (and a light touch with the mayonnaise) that makes their flavors bright and bold. From the Classic (which includes a splash of vinegar to round out the flavors) to fan-favorite Garlic Parmesan, there&rsquo;s a Birdie&rsquo;s flavor for every palate and occasion.&nbsp;</p>
