          <p>Boxcarr Handmade Cheese was founded by siblings Samantha and Austin Genke in 2015. With the help of family and friends, these first-generation farmers took the leap to start producing handmade cheese on their farm in Cedar Grove, N.C. Their creamery overlooks the pond on the 30 acre farm where they also grow heirloom produce and raise chickens, pigs, turkeys, and, of course, a herd of dairy goats.</p>
          <p>Austin Genke started farming in 2009 after moving to North Carolina with his wife Dani. Austin is a CIA trained chef and spent time working in well-known fine dining restaurants. In addition to Boxcarr Handmade Cheese and living and working on Boxcarr Farms with their three kids, Dani and Austin run a gourmet food truck that serves what they grow.</p>
          <p>Samantha Genke has been working on honing her skills in cheesemaking for over 16 years. She worked at some of the best creameries in North Carolina! Samantha brings all of her knowledge of cheesemaking and the inspiration of her Italian ancestral roots to every batch that is crafted by Boxcarr Handmade Cheese.</p>
