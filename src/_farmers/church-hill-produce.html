          <p>Michael and Kari Sponaugle of Church Hill Produce LLC (CHP) in Highland County, VA have grown fresh fruit and vegetables since 2011. A successful 4-H sweet corn fundraiser and tending overabundant family gardens as newlyweds, Michael and Kari jumped into vegetable farming with both feet a year into their marriage. After six years with a wide variety of crops and a mobile farm stand with 3 locations a week and the arrival of their two boys, in late 2016 they decided to specialize in what they grew best, narrowing down their offering to a “mere” 25 different crops. In 2017, CHP won Local Food Hub's "Rookie of the Year" award having expanded from their original 8 acres to 25 acres. The COVID pandemic enabled the farm to offer a farm share that Kari delivered weekly to customers in two states and three counties from 2020-2023. In 2021, the farm further narrowed their produce offering and doubled in size, totaling over 50 acres in production as well as increased wholesale produce distribution.</p>
          <p>Natural springs and creeks feeding the headwaters of the James River provide water for their farm. They use cover crops and nutrient management plans (NMPs) to enrich and protect the soil. Located in Virginia's 6B hardiness zone, west of the Shenandoah Valley, CHP's season is much shorter with last/first frost dates of May 10th and September 10th. Kari and Michael are certified private pesticide applicators, with Kari holding a Commercial Research and Demonstration certification for her 'day job' work as an Extension Agent. CHP implements low or no-spray methods, and in 2022 added a DJI T40 ag drone for precision application and less land compaction. Church Hill Produce has been an H-GAP (harmonized good agricultural practices) farm since 2017 through <a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/grower-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Food Hub’s Grower Services</a>, enabling them to reach more wholesale markets for their produce.</p>
          <p>Kari and Michael complement each other well on the farm; Kari manages payroll, food safety, accounting, direct-to-consumer sales and social media. Michael is the 'in field' manager and coordinates wholesale orders. Crops you can expect from the CHP lineup include spring and fall broccoli, collard greens and kale, roma and juice tomatoes, bell peppers, slicing cucumbers and squash. The family grows a handful of Kennebec potatoes that they sell locally by the bushel.</p>
          <p>When they’re not tending the “vegetable patch,” Michael can be found working cattle or checking on turkeys at the family’s home farm in Doe Hill, while Kari serves as the Highland-Bath Agriculture Extension Agent, providing educational opportunities for farmers and youth livestock exhibitors. Their three children — Jasper, Clu, and Michaela — are growing up alongside their hardworking parents, active in the local 4-H program and gaining valuable life lessons from their agricultural upbringing.</p>
