          <p><a href="https://www.deeprootsmilling.com/about-us">Deep Roots Milling</a> produces high quality flours that help create a strong, healthy equitable food system of a diverse network of small growers. As a member of the <a href="https://www.commongrainalliance.org/buy-our-grain">Common Grain Alliance</a>, all of the grain that Deep Roots Milling uses is responsibly sourced from family farms on the East Coast.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Deep Roots Milling operates out of historic Woodson&rsquo;s Mill in Nelson County, VA. Woodson&rsquo;s Mill was originally built in the 1790&rsquo;s and has been in operation throughout the majority of its history.</p>
          <p>Mills like Woodson&rsquo;s used to serve vital community roles across America. However, with the industrialization of the food system, these country mills could not compete. Woodson&rsquo;s Mill is one of the last of these exquisite structures and the team at Deep Roots Milling are bringing it back to life.</p>
          <p>They use water-power to grind grain and take advantage of the lessons learned by generations of&nbsp; millers. They use 48 inch stones that were installed in the mill back in the 1840&rsquo;s. These remarkable stones produce high quality products packed with flavor and nutrients. This process is also inherently environmentally sustainable. Woodson&rsquo;s Mill is the last commercially operated water powered mill in Virginia. It is an important piece of the agricultural community and in the mission to rebuild a regenerative food system.</p>
