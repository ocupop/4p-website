          <p>With so many awesome fruits, veggies, and greens , wouldn't it be nice to have an all-natural, locally-made dressing to drizzle on top of them? The good news is that we've got <a href="https://dressitupdressing.com/">Dress It Up Dressing</a>, a woman-owned business based out of Bethesda, MD.</p>
          <p>Dress It Up Dressing was founded by Sophia Maroon, who long enjoyed eating salads with her mother's simple but irresistible balsamic vinaigrette recipe. Her brother encouraged her to bottle and sell the sauce, and over time she decided to launch the business and create a full line of additive- and preservative-free salad dressings.</p>
          <p>If you've ever wondered "what to wear" on your next dish, Dress It Up Dressing has you covered with 6 flavors: Apple Cider Vinaigrette, Blackberry Vinaigrette, Caesar Dressing, Champagne Vinaigrette, Red Wine Vinaigrette, and Sesame Tahini Dressing. They're all gluten-free, low in sodium, and several are Whole30 compliant and Certified Kosher. The dressings are crafted with pure 100% olive oil and made without water, so their thick, creamy consistency and concentrated flavors are quite versatile.</p>

          <p>With Dress It Up Dressing, the goodness is inside and the outside. Each label is a work of art created by artist Inslee Fariss (Sophia was once her babysitter!) and Sophia's sister Anne, a graphic designer. Look closely at the bottle and you'll see that each woman's fantastic outfit is playfully embellished with food!</p>
          <p>Dress It Up Dressing is also committed to quality and sustainability, manufacturing their products responsibly and supporting Good Food access in their community. A Certified B Corporation, the company has been supplying dressing to DC Public Schools at a reduced cost since 2016 to help build healthy eating habits and food relationships in school children. They also provided over 20,000 meals to children during the COVID-19 pandemic, and donated 10,000 dressing packets to <a href="https://wck.org/">World Central Kitchen</a>. In March 2020, through 4P Foods and <a href="https://mafrac.com/">MAFRAC</a>, their dressings accompanied 375 salad kits made with locally-grown greens and eggs.</p>
          <p>While Dress It Up Dressings will make all your raw or cooked veggies more glamorous, you can also enjoy them on grilled fruits, as a marinade for meats or seafood, or on a cheese plate. They have lots of <a href="https://dressitupdressing.com/blogs/recipes">recipes</a> on their website! We love a smashed raw green bean salad tossed in Champagne Vinaigrette and freshly-grated Parmesan cheese. Be on the lookout for Dress It Up Dressing in your 4P Produce Bags.&nbsp;</p>
