          <p>With so many seasonal and healthy fruits, veggies, we're fortunate to have a nationally-acclaimed salad dressing company local to our region for the perfect 4P Bag companion. Our local artisan partner, Dress It Up Dressing is a woman-owned business based out of Bethesda, MD who believes your produce deserves to be paired with an equally nutritious and delicious dressing.</p>
          <p>Dress It Up Dressing was founded by Sophia Maroon, who long enjoyed eating salads with her mother's simple but irresistible balsamic vinaigrette recipe. Her brother encouraged her to bottle and sell the sauce, and over time she decided to launch the business and create a full line of additive- and preservative-free salad dressings.</p>
          <p>If you've ever wondered "what to wear" on your next dish, Dress It Up Dressing has you covered with 6 flavors: Apple Cider Vinaigrette, Blackberry Vinaigrette, Caesar Dressing, Champagne Vinaigrette, Red Wine Vinaigrette, and Sesame Tahini Dressing. They're all gluten-free, low in sodium, and several are Whole30 compliant and Certified Kosher. The dressings are crafted with pure 100% olive oil and made without water, so their thick, creamy consistency and concentrated flavors are quite versatile.</p>
          <p>With Dress It Up Dressing, the goodness is inside and the outside. Each label is a work of art created by artist Inslee Fariss (Sophia was once her babysitter!) and Sophia's sister Anne, a graphic designer. Look closely at the bottle and you'll see that each woman's fantastic outfit is playfully embellished with food!</p>
          <p><strong>Community Impact</strong></p>
          <p>Dress It Up Dressing is committed to quality and sustainability, manufacturing their products responsibly and supporting Good Food access in their community. A Certified B Corporation, the company has been supplying dressing to DC Public Schools at a reduced cost since 2016 to help build healthy eating habits and food relationships in school children.</p>
          <p>In 2019, Dressing It Up Dressing won the Stacy's Rise Project for their community support efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sofi and the company made contributions to lunch programs to feed children, as well as partnered with World Central Kitchen (WCK), DC Central Kitchen, the Mid Atlantic Food Resilience and Action Coalition (MAFRAC) and 4P Foods. In March 2020, Dressing It Up Dressing packets were distributed with 375 locally sourced salad kits as part of 4P's <a href="https://4pfoods.com/posts/2020-year-in-review/">pay-what-you-can meal distribution</a>.</p>
          <p>Dress It Up is also a two-time recipient of the Specialty Outstanding Food Innovation (sofi) Award (it's like the Oscars for Food), and has also won a Good Food Award.</p>
          <p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>
          <p>While Dress It Up Dressings will make all your raw or cooked veggies more glamorous, you can also enjoy them on grilled fruits, as a marinade for meats or seafood, or on a cheese plate. We love a smashed raw green bean salad tossed in Champagne Vinaigrette and freshly-grated Parmesan cheese.
