          <p>As a company, 4P Foods is local-focused and we prioritize our local farm partners first. However, our local beef farmers are currently experiencing unprecedented demand due to the pandemic, and partnerships with small-scale, sustainable family farms outside our region broaden our mutual horizons and help ease some of the strain on our community partners. Enter our exciting new partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://e3ranch.com/">E3 Ranch</a>, a 6th generation farm in Fort Scott, Kansas, currently under the care of the LaRoche Family.</p>
          <p>Adam Laroche, former Nationals first baseman, runs independent, family-owned E3 Ranch in the heart of the Prairie grasslands in Kansas. 4P Foods has a&nbsp;<a href="https://curlyw.mlblogs.com/a-letter-to-nationals-fans-from-mark-d-lerner-c41ada65c7f3">long-time relationship with the Washington Nationals</a>&nbsp;by way of the Washington Youth Baseball Academy, one of our DC-based community partners working to build food equity in the DC-area.</p>
          <p>E3 Certified cattle are raised on the ranch or smaller family farms by ranchers who raise cattle to E3&rsquo;s protocols, with sustainable stewardship of the land and respect for the animals. E3&rsquo;s Certified black and red Angus cattle (with genuine Angus specific genetics) are free to roam on pasture and do their natural part in restoring the landscape, eating a completely sustainable diet, and ultimately creating nutrient-dense, excellent-tasting food. Every part of E3&rsquo;s steers are used &ndash; they offer meats, natural pet foods, and even tan hides to produce leather goods.</p>
          <p>E3 beef is graded USDA Prime or USDA choice and grazed under a transparent pasture to plate story. E3 Ranch&rsquo;s cattle are grass-fed and grain-finished on 2000+ acres, raised with no antibiotics ever,&nbsp; no steroids, and never any growth hormones. Grain-finished means the animals are only fed grains during the last 30 to 90 days before they are harvested. This is different than 100% grass-fed or grass-finished animals, which eat only grass and forage during their lifetimes.</p>
          <p>The high-energy grains that E3&rsquo;s grain-finished animals eat result in more marbling (fat content, which translates to juiciness) and a milder flavor than grass-finished beef. 100% grass-fed beef has a much more pronounced flavor and a less tender texture that may not appeal to every palette. Grain-finishing also makes sense for ranchers in areas where grass doesn&rsquo;t grow well year-round.</p>
          <p>E3 Ranch is also committed to serving others. In addition to raising beef cattle, they also work to support like-minded small family ranches, run two ranch-to-table restaurants, and their E3 Ranch Foundation helps veterans, active military, and victims of human trafficking by providing a place to rest and reconnect at their ranch. A portion of all E3 Beef goes back to support E3&rsquo;s local community.</p>
          <p>4P Foods partners exclusively with farms and artisan producers who share our values of good food&mdash; transparently sourced, dense in nutrients, ethically raised and produced with regenerative agricultural practices. Starting in May, you can get E3 Farms high-quality beef in the 4P Protein Bag! Our hyper-local partners are continuing to raise livestock and rotate to fresh pastures daily. In addition to E3 beef, we will soon have products available from our hyper-local grass-fed partner, &nbsp;J&amp;L Green Farms, as well as Firsthand Foods and more.</p>
