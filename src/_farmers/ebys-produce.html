          <p>Eby's Produce, owned by John Eby, grows a variety of vegetables, with a focus on root vegetables (like the lovely turnips pictured here), in Pittsylvania County, VA. John has been in the farming business for more than forty years! He and neighboring farmers like Brick Goldman of <a href="https://4pfoods.com/farmers/goldman-farm/">Goldman Farm</a> and DJ Livengood of <a href="https://4pfoods.com/farmers/walnut-winds-farm/">Walnut Winds Farm</a> sometimes coordinate deliveries to 4P's Ivy warehouse outside of Charlottesville, where we help distribute their products to households, restaurants, and institutions throughout the region. Without having to worry about the logistics and sales &amp; marketing, growers like John can focus on doing what they do best &mdash; growing food!</p>
          <p>In 2021, 4P's procurement team worked with John and dozens of other growers on production planning for the growing season to come. One exciting outcome of this process with Eby's was expanding the varieties of radishes he grows to bring color to our spring and early summer deliveries with varieties like gumball and white icicle.</p>
