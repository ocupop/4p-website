          John Straw knew he wanted to be a farmer since he was a child. During the summers, he preferred to go with his father to work. His father worked directly with farmers and producers to research and diagnose pest, disease or infestation issues and help resolve them. John started farming right out of high school and has not stopped since. He and his family farm on 40 acres and grow a variety of vegetables that they sell out of their farm stand. He sells sweet yellow onions, watermelons and all kinds of beautiful pumpkins to 4P Foods. “Organizations like 4P Foods are so beneficial for smaller growers like us. They help fill that gap. There is value to be had for getting more local products. It helps to have somebody to bridge that gap between the farmer and large institutions.” - John Straw
