          <p>Fields Edge Farm is owned by Leslie and Roger Slusher on a beautiful 145 acres in Floyd County. Farmer Kat Johnson joined Fields Edge in 2018 bringing years of experience to the farm. The Slusher family has been farming in Floyd County since 1780. The current farm has been in the family since 1955. Fields Edge was the first farm in Floyd County to be preserved by the Virginia Outdoors Foundation. The Slusher Family is committed to continuing to serve as caretakers for the land, preserving it for the generations to come.</p>
          <p>Leslie and Roger raise a variety of vegetables on two cultivated acres and a high tunnel, with a focus on alliums (such as leeks, shallots, and garlic) and potatoes. They also raised grass-fed cattle.</p>
          <p>Fields Edge is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/grower-services/">Local Food Hub partner farm</a>. We are proud to partner with<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/"> Local Food Hub</a> to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P customers.</p>
