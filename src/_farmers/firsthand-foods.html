          <p><a href="https://firsthandfoods.com/">Firsthand Foods</a> began as Durham, NC's first woman-owned mobile Sausage Wagon and has grown into a food hub serving their home state and surrounding area and meeting the region's growing demand for local, sustainable, and humanely raised meats.</p>
          <p>When they met, founders Jennifer Curtis and Tina Prevatte Levy realized they shared a passion for supporting small farmers who are often overlooked in the massive global food supply chain, and sought to create new opportunities for these farmers while increasing the public's access to meats that are raised in a spirit of fairness and stewardship.</p>

          <p>Their core values are dignity and quality: they only source from farmers who raise their animals with respect and keep them out on pasture to live natural lives. This means no growth-promoting antibiotics, hormonal implants, animal byproducts in feed, and complete traceability every step of the way. Beyond the farm and at the table, Firsthand Foods collects feedback from chefs and consumers to share with farmers to ensure their dedicated practices result in the best products.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Firsthand Foods has been recognized for their impact on the community and the local-regional food system.

Their lamb is certified Animal Welfare Approved by <a href="https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9KX65-m26wIVDgiICR1AkArPEAAYASABEgIJZ_D_BwE">A Greener World.</a></p>

We love partnering with a fellow food hub that values people and the planet while building a stronger food community.
