          <p>Franklin Sustainable Farms Cooperative was formed by a group of farmers suddenly faced with no outlet when another co-op unexpectedly closed. Backed by dedicated Amish farmers whose families have been stewards of the land for generations, Franklin Sustainable Farms is a collaboratively owned and operated agriculture cooperative where farmers pool and share resources in order to meet common needs. Since the beginning, the cooperative has reaped the benefit of a community approach. In order to take off, the group of farmers rallied together, built a new facility with loading docks, packing areas and a large ice room.</p>
          <p>The Amish do not use electricity ever and so fresh harvests are kept cool with the natural cooling system of the ice room. To maintain, the farmers harvest ice from ponds on their land and haul it to the dock by wagon. Ice is then stacked into the large cooling room and provides enough cold air for the perfect temperature to temporarily store the freshly picked produce.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The facility and farms are certified in Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), a rigorous food safety audit program, and USDA Organic certifications. Franklin Sustainable Farms strives to bring only top quality produce at reasonable prices while remaining sustainable. We also offer local items from sister farms in the community. Many of these young farmers in the local community are now looking to become Organic Certified to join the cooperative&rsquo;s mission of delivering the freshest, sustainable produce possible.</p>
          <p>4P Foods partnered with Franklin Sustainable Farms this winter to bring you diverse organically grown produce such as sunchokes, celeriac, potatoes, colorful mixed radishes, and more.
