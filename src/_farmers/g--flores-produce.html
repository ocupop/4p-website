          <p>Located in Virginia's Northern Neck region, <a href="https://gfloresproduce.square.site/">G. Flores Produce</a>&nbsp;is a family farm committed to sustainable agricultural practices. On over 40 acres of land, second-generation farmer Omar and his relatives grow a wide variety of produce that changes with the seasons.</p>

          <p>Their offerings change almost weekly and depending on the time of year contain everything from kale, greens, and lettuce varieties to alliums (the onion family!), snap peas, tomatoes, peppers, squashes, melons, root vegetables, herbs, berries, and&nbsp; more. They also grow unique specialties like squash blossoms and sorrel.</p>

          <p>You might recognize&nbsp; G. Flores Produce from our first-ever Salsa Kit in our 4P Produce Bags this summer. They grew the tomatillos, garlic, and jalapenos for your spicy, do-it-yourself treat! With a tagline like "The Flores farm. Where life is a beauty...We wouldn't change anything for the world. We love what we do," you know that the Flores family grows every lush, colorful fruit and vegetable on their farm with great passion and care.</p>
