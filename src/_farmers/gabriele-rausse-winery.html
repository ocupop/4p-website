          <p>In 2014, Gabriele Rausse Winery leased 16 acres of land on the historic Redlands Farm above the Hardware River near Carter&rsquo;s Bridge. Although most of the vineyard is dedicated to growing grapes exclusively for wine, in 2016 Gabriele decided to plant Chasselas Dor&eacute;. The variety is among the first that Jefferson attempted to grow at Monticello, and is prized as a table grape around the world. It is also grown extensively in Switzerland to produce wine. 4P Foods looks forward to featuring this unique variety of grape as a table grape through our partnership with Local Food Hub.</p>
          <p>Gabriele Rausse Winery is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
