          <p>Goldman Farm is a sixth generation family farm in Charlotte County, VA. Brick Goldman, the current owner and farm manager, is known as a community leader, especially among fellow farmers. Brick began working with Local Food Hub in 2013, when a network of growers in the Lynchburg and Danville areas got together to pursue new market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Brick and nearby farmers DJ Livengood, of Walnut Winds Farm, and John Eby, of Eby&rsquo;s Produce, often coordinate deliveries to Local Food Hub, where their products then make their way to schools, hospitals, restaurants, and markets throughout the region. Local Food Hub takes care of liability and insurance requirements, marketing, and transportation so that these farmers can focus more on growing food and less on logistics.</p>
          <p>Brick uses many sustainable farming techniques on his farm, including crop rotation and off-season cover crops, to ensure the soil is rich and ready for the next season&rsquo;s planting. He has a high regard for food safety, and recently achieved GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) certification, a government- and industry-recognized standard in food safety.</p>

          <p>While Brick was already following many GAP requirements, Local Food Hub helped him navigate the lengthy application process and provided cost-sharing opportunities for him to achieve GAP certification in late summer 2015. This certification has expanded his market opportunities and brought greater value to his products.</p>
          <p>Goldman Farm grows many traditional southern favorites, including collard greens, kale, summer squash, peas, and more. His produce makes its way into the hands of hungry schoolchildren, such as during Charlottesville City Schools&rsquo; Harvest of the Month Program. During the spring 2015 program, students tasted Brick&rsquo;s farm fresh sugar snap peas, which was a very special snack as students participated in a friendly pea growing competition prior to tasting their local snack.</p>
          <p>Goldman Farm is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
