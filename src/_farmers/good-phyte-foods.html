          <p>Made from scratch, good phyte energy bars are vegan, grain-free, nut-free, and in commercially compostable packaging! Stacy Miller founded good phyte foods in 2016 after being frustrated trying to find nutritious organic snacks for her first son. Since then, their products have expanded to include delicious grain-free seed &amp; veggie crackers, granola, and more. All <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://goodphytefoods.com/our-story">good phyte</a> products are made in Charlottesville, VA.</p>
          <p>As an avid 4P Foods supporter,&nbsp; Stacy began using locally-sourced produce to craft her wholesome and delicious energy bars and other snacks in Charlottesville, VA. 4P Foods was thrilled to welcome Good Phyte Foods as an official 4P Foods partner in March 2020, offering energy bars in our Produce Bags and more.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The name "Good Phyte" comes from the Greek word&nbsp;<em>phyte,&nbsp;</em>meaning "of plant origin." Good Phyte bars are made with whole organic seeds, organic dried fruit, and dried vegetables - chock-full of phytonutrients and whole plant proteins for long-lasting, healthy energy to fuel your adventures. Good Phyte's products are vegan and grain-free, with no nuts, no added sugars, and no preservatives. In addition to bars, they also make crackers, granola, and salad bowls.</p>
          <p>Good Phyte Foods is also committed to supporting local business and sustainable agriculture. Produce in their products comes from 4P/LFH partner farms, including&nbsp;<a href="/farmers/bellair-farm/">Bellair Farm</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/farmers/schuyler-greens-company/">Schuyler Greens</a>,&nbsp;<a href="/farmers/planet-earth-diversified/">Planet Earth Diversified</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="/farmers/radical-roots-community-farm/">Radical Roots Farm</a>.</p>
