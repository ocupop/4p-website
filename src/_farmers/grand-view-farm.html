  Michael and Savannah raise their animals with the utmost care and integrity,
  guided by regenerative practices that prioritize soil health, animal welfare,
  and ecological balance. Their cattle are 100% grass-fed and grass-finished,
  moved frequently across lush, untreated pastures. Their pigs and poultry live
  outdoors year-round, rooting and foraging on pasture as nature intended.
