  P.J. Haynie is a fifth-generation Black farmer whose journey from Virginia's
  Northern Neck to the Arkansas Delta has redefined what it means to build a
  generational legacy, food sovereignty, and equity in American agriculture. As
  the owner of Arkansas River Rice, the only Black-owned rice mill in the United
  States, Haynie is not only preserving his family's farming legacy but also
  reshaping the future of agribusiness.
