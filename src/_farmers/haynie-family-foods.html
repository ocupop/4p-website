          P.J. Haynie is a fifth-generation Black farmer whose journey from Virginia's Northern Neck to the Arkansas Delta has redefined what it means to build a generational legacy, food sovereignty, and equity in American agriculture. As the owner of Arkansas River Rice, the only Black-owned rice mill in the United States, Haynie is not only preserving his family's farming legacy but also reshaping the future of agribusiness.<p></p>
          <p>Haynie recently launched Haynie Family Foods; this new venture aims to bring consumable products derived from the crops the family grows such as packaged rice, wheat flour, canola oil, cornmeal, and other products directly to consumers. <a href="https://hayniefamilyfoods.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haynie Family Foods</a> will create a direct line from farm to table, centering equity, quality, and traceability. It represents the next chapter in P.J.’s mission to create a more regenerative and inclusive food system—one that honors tradition while innovating for the future.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>A Legacy Rooted in Resilience</h2>
          <p>Haynie's agricultural roots trace back to his great-great-grandfather, Robert Haynie, who was born enslaved in 1823 and later purchased 60 acres in Virginia in 1867. That land became the foundation of Haynie Farms, which today produces corn, wheat, barley, soybeans, yellow peas, and canola across Virginia's Northern Neck. P.J. expanded the family operation to Arkansas, where he cultivates rice and soybeans on over 5,000 acres.</p>
          <p>In 2021, the Haynie family acquired a state-of-the-art rice mill in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, transforming it into <a href="https://youtu.be/OeGjz42Stqs?si=XK05ULUnCmJja3FQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arkansas River Rice Mill</a>—the only Black-owned rice mill in the U.S. The facility can process 22 metric tons of rice per hour. Products include long-grain and medium-grain white rice, long-grain and medium-grain brown rice, and brewers’ rice. After securing food-grade certification in 2022, Haynie began selling to institutional buyers like food service distributors, universities, and USDA international food aid programs.</p>

          <h5>“We’re hoping to supply quality rice and food products to communities that appreciate where their food comes from, and the hands that grew it.” - P.J. Haynie, CEO Haynie Family Foods and Arkansas River Rice Mill</h5>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Climate-Smart and Community-Focused</h2>
          <p>Haynie employs sustainable farming practices like Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) to significantly reduce methane gas emissions and conserve water in rice production. Beyond environmental stewardship, his mission is deeply tied to economic justice. By vertically integrating his operations—from farming to milling to packaging—Haynie aims to make a greater economic impact in his community.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Advocacy and Recognition</h2>
          <p>As chairman of the National Black Growers Council (NBGC), Haynie advocates for the efficiency, productivity, and sustainability of Black row crop farmers nationwide. His leadership earned him the 2023 Farm Foundation Innovator of the Year award, and he was a finalist for Farm Journal’s Top Producer of the Year. He also served on the USDA Equity Commission, working to address systemic disparities in agriculture.</p>
          <p>P.J. Haynie's journey is a testament to resilience, innovation, and the transformative power of agriculture. Through Haynie Family Foods, he is not only honoring his ancestors' legacy but also paving the way for future generations of Black farmers.</p>
