          <p>Keith Holland's family has been farming in Rockbridge County for almost 100 years, since his grandfather purchased land in the 1920s and began a family farm. Much of Keith&rsquo;s farming knowledge was passed on from his grandfather and has enabled him to expertly manage the over 1500 acres that make up the farm today. Located at the intersection of three rivers &ndash; the Maury, South, and James &ndash; where the soil is rich and ideal for growing produce, Holland&rsquo;s Three Rivers Farm grows delicious, diversified produce on 60 acres, and operates a livestock and grain operation on the rest of the land.</p>

          <p>Holland&rsquo;s Three Rivers Farm has been working with Local Food Hub since 2012 and is a reliable producer for some of our larger customers. Keith delivers summer squash, sweet corn, and bell peppers to our warehouse by the truckload, and provides a consistent supply of pastured eggs. In addition to working with Local Food Hub, the farm also hosts Family Farm Day events, operates a retail farm stand, and partners with the local jail to provide employment opportunities to inmates, some of whom become future employees upon their release.</p>
          <p>Holland's Three Rivers is a <a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/grower-services/">Local Food Hub partner farm</a>. We are proud to partner with<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/"> Local Food Hub</a> to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P customers.</p>
