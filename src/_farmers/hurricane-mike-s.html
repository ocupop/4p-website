          "Life’s too short for boring food,” says Mike Oughton, Founder Hurricane Mike’s.<p></p>
          <p>Hurricane Mike’s is a veteran and woman-owned small-batch sauce and seasoning creator. Owners Mike and Gina think that making great food is a great way to show love for family and friends. Their sauces and seasonings begin with fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, and other natural ﬂavors.</p>
          <p>Growing up and studying music in Dallas, TX, Mike later served as a United States Marine and in the US Army. Since his Granny let him play in the kitchen at a early age, Mike saw cooking as a creative outlet. Great food became a life-long passion, eventually learning to make amazing sauces with velvety textures, experiential ﬂavors, and seasonings that enhance and bring out the best in your cooking.</p>
          <p>Gina has always had a penchant for visionary thinking. She’s fueled this journey with the ideas you see as their brand today and always with encouragement and enthusiasm.</p>
