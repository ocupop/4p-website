          <p>Kalona SuperNatural is a small farming community in the heartland of America. They work with small, sustainable family farms to provide delicious, certified organic whole milk and dairy products from regeneratively-managed, grass-fed cows.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Kalona SuperNatural believes in going beyond the organic practices required by the government&ndash; for the health of animals, the planet and your family.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Our herd is free-range and pastures year-round, rejuvenating the soil, water, and air. Their movements create healthier milk with a natural goodness that we protect through minimal processing in our creamery&rdquo;, says Kalona SuperNatural.&nbsp;</p>
