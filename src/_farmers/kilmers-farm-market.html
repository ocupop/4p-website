          <p>Owner and Operator Derek Lewis Kilmer is a third-generation farmer that brought his family’s fruit growing and selling into the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Kilmers have a rich family history in farming. Derek's great grandfather was a farmer, dairy man and small fruit grower, but it is his grandfather, Charles W. Lewis who is remembered as a professional, dedicated, and superior fruit grower. Charles and his wife Wanda owned and operated 500 acres in West Virginia until their daughter and her husband-Derek Kilmer’s parents-took over in 1986. Derek worked on the farm alongside his parents until they retired in 2012.</p>
          <p>In 2008, the local food movement took off. For the next 8 years, Kilmer’s Farm Market saw dramatic growth in sales. During this time, Derek expanded the family farm by growing other fruits and vegetables in addition to the traditional peaches and apples.</p>
