          <p>Little Hat Creek Farm is a <a href="https://littlehatcreek.wordpress.com/farm-practices/">diversified ecological vegetable</a> farm and wood-fired bakery nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Owners Ben and Heather specialize in using regional flours to produce naturally-leavened bread, croissants, cookies, crackers, and other baked goods. Everything they produce is baked in a&nbsp; 5&rsquo;x7&rsquo; wood fire oven on their farm.</p>
          <p>Ben and Heather&rsquo;s passion for regional grain motivated them to help found the <a href="http://commongrainalliance.org/">Common Grain Alliance</a>, a non-profit that seeks to revitalize the grain economy in the Mid-Atlantic.</p>
          <p>DID YOU KNOW? Wheat can only be a sustainable crop when paired with other crops like buckwheat, rye, and millet.</p>
          <p>Little Hat Creek Farm supports local millers by buying what is available and turning that product into delicious baked goods like their Rye Chocolate Chip Cookies.</p>
