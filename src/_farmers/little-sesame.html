          <p>"Investing in food is investing in each other," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/14/we-changed-how-we-operate-face-crisis-society-should-do-same/?arc404=true">wrote Nick Wiseman</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://eatlittlesesame.com/about/story/">Little Sesame</a>, a restaurant in Washington, DC. The story of how their business model transformed in the face of the pandemic and how their delicious hummus wound up in your 4P Produce Bag is an inspiring one, demonstrating the resilience of a local food system and the power of community.</p>
          <p>Little Sesame is a fast-casual cafe style eatery serving fresh, veggie-centric Middle Eastern inspired fare, including appetizers, hummus bowls, pita sandwiches, and unique beverages and desserts. Nick created Little Sesame in 2016&nbsp; with partners David Wiseman and Ronen Tenne in the 500 square foot basement of a former deli, drawing on their combined culinary backgrounds, shared experiences in travel, and mutal love of good food.</p>
          <p>Nick and Ronen met while working as chefs in New York City. Nick is a DC native, and started cooking at fifteen. He's been working with his cousin David for the past ten years to build relationships with farmers to source their menu ingredients, such as special varieties of organic chickpeas. Ronen is from Tivon, Israel, where memories of the markets drew him to cooking food and informed the creation of his dishes.</p>
          <p>After opening its first location in Chinatown, Little Sesame opened a second location in Dupont Circle and plans to open a third in the Metro Center. They aimed to create communities around their restaurants, and soon built a devoted following around their unique menu and what the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/restaurants/little-sesame-serves-the-best-hummus-in-dc-and-its-good-enough-to-be-your-entree/2018/10/09/6fcc9ac8-c8b2-11e8-9b1c-a90f1daae309_story.html">Washington Post</a> called "the best hummus in DC." With many vegetarian and vegan options, exciting flavors like zataar and sumac, and rich soft serve made from the sesame paste tahini, their menu offers something different and delicious for everyone.</p>
          <p>In addition to their restaurants, the Little Sesame team also started the <a href="http://eatlittlesesame.com/little-seedlings/">Little Seedlings</a> program, an annual fellowship to support young farmers and their new farms with grants offered in conjunction with the National Young Farmers Coalition.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>But when the city began to feel the effects of the pandemic, Little Sesame was threatened with closure like many other neighborhood eateries. (The bar and restaurant industries <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">shed</a> almost half a million jobs in March 2020). Nick and his team decided that they would change their business model in the light of the economic crises and school closings that highlighted DC's food insecurity.</p>
          <p>Little Sesame launched <a href="https://littlesesameadventures.com/pages/meals-for-the-city">Meals for the City</a>, which made local commercial kitchens into community kitchens for preparing meals for their neighbors who have been most deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, they've served more than 10,000 meals and continue to feed their DC neighbors at their Chinatown location through World Central Kitchen.</p>
          <p>4P Foods was excited to support Little Sesame and their mission to improve food access in the city - and their signature hummus became the perfect accompaniment to our Produce Bag veggies. Creamy and craveable with just the right amount of spice, it's become a 4P favorite!</p>
          <p>Little Sesame is currently open for pick up and delivery at their Golden Triangle location. Stay tuned for details about their upcoming Metro Center location!</p>
