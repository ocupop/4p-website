          <p>Daniel and Ashley Malcolm grew up in Albemarle County where their love for the land started at an early age. After some time spent in Delaware where Daniel established a successful 180 member CSA for the Delaware Nature Society, the couple returned to Virginia in 2013 to run their own operation on family land in Staunton.</p>
          <p>As one of the few remaining farms in Staunton, Daniel and Ashley are committed to protecting and preserving their farmland while growing delicious fruits and vegetables. The Malcolms grow over 30 different crops on eight acres of land, with high volumes of onions, peppers, and sweet corn. Other items include peas, spinach, tomatoes, melons, kale, beets, broccoli, and more.</p>
          <p>In 2013, the Malcolms won the Community Food Rookie of the Year Award for their sense of enthusiasm and commitment to working with Local Food Hub, and for finding their footing in the local community after just one growing season. Now into their third season with Local Food Hub, they appear to be well beyond &ldquo;Rookie&rdquo; status.</p>
          <p>Malcolms Market is is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
