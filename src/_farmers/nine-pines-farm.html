          Nine Pines Farm is a pasture-based livestock and fresh cut flower farm located in York, PA. James, Becky, and their four children raise chickens, turkey, duck, and hogs, and sheep. <p>The farm started as a hobby by James, who grew up working on dairy and cattle farms. As the family began to add additional livestock, a small business was created, then grew, and grew. In March of 2021, James left his full-time job and began his journey as a full time farmer. </p>
          <p>"To say we are blessed to do this is an understatement. We continue to do our very best to deliver wholesome, nutrient dense food to our local community and beyond," says James Comwell. "Coming from a farming family, I was always told I wouldn't be able to be a full-time farmer and raise a family from that income alone... Well, here we are, farming, and making an honest living and doing fine! To those that say regenerative small farms can't feed the world, keep saying that, because we will prove you wrong!"</p>
