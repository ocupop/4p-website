  NoBull started with a mom on a mission. Long before veggie burgers became
  trendy, Elizabeth Raymond was blending organic lentils, grains, and vegetables
  into hearty, flavorful patties her kids actually loved. What began as a
  homemade solution to feeding her family well quickly grew into something much
  bigger: a company committed to real, nourishing food with ingredients you can
  pronounce.
