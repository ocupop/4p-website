  NoBull started with a mom on a mission. Long before veggie burgers became
  trendy, Elizabeth Raymond was blending organic lentils, grains, and vegetables
  into hearty, flavorful patties her kids actually loved. What began as a
  homemade solution to feeding her family well quickly grew into something much
  bigger: a company committed to real, nourishing food with ingredients you can
  pronounce.

          At 4P Foods, we’re proud to work with producers who believe that good food starts with integrity—from the soil it’s grown in to the hands that craft it. That’s why we’re excited to share the story behind NoBull Burgers, a family-run company out of Charlottesville, Virginia, redefining what it means to eat plant-based.<p></p>
                     <p>NoBull started with a mom on a mission. Long before veggie burgers became trendy, Elizabeth Raymond was blending organic lentils, grains, and vegetables into hearty, flavorful patties her kids actually loved. What began as a homemade solution to feeding her family well quickly grew into something much bigger: a company committed to real, nourishing food with ingredients you can pronounce.</p>
                     <p>Unlike many meat alternatives on the market, NoBull doesn’t try to imitate meat—it celebrates vegetables for what they are. Each burger is handcrafted with organic lentils and brown rice, seasoned with herbs and spices, and packed with whole, plant-based ingredients. No soy isolates, no weird powders—just real food, made the old-fashioned way. From Madras Curry to Sun-Dried Tomato to Savory Mushroom, each variety is rich in flavor and deeply satisfying, even to the most skeptical carnivore.</p>
                     <p>At its core, NoBull is about transparency, sustainability, and love—for people, for the planet, and for the kind of food that makes you feel good. Their small-batch production process ensures quality and care in every patty, while their commitment to using organic, non-GMO, and gluten-free ingredients makes their food accessible to all eaters.</p>
                     <p>We admire NoBull’s no-compromise approach: simple ingredients, honest flavors, and a deep-rooted belief that food should fuel and inspire. Their values align with ours—building a regional food system that prioritizes health, equity, and sustainability. NoBull Burgers remind us that plant-based eating doesn’t have to be complicated. It just has to be real.</p>
                     <p>And that’s no bull. Find out more at <a href="https://nobullburger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nobullburger.com</a>.</p>
