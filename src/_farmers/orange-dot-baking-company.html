          <p>Inspired by a review of poverty in her hometown of Charlottesville, VA called the Orange Dot Report, Susan Freeman Weiner conceived of Orange Dot Baking Company to generate local employment while producing a healthy, flavorful alternative to existing high-glycemic, gluten free breads.</p>
          <p>As an avid gluten free cook, Susan built Orange Dot on innovation in both its baking process and its recipes&mdash;much to the delight of her celiac son, Andrew. Orange Dot&rsquo;s bread is special because it is made with an innovative, proprietary baking process that locks in the moisture and expands the cell structure of the bread. The recipes are also innovative because they: 1) do not use any xanthan gum (which causes intestinal distress!), 2) are low in tapioca starch (which is high-glycemic!), 3) are packed with high energy ingredients like organic eggs and sunflower, pumpkin, quinoa, chia and amaranth seeds, and 4) are baked with great flavors!</p>

          <p>It is a versatile English muffin style bread that works well as French toast for breakfast, a turkey sandwich for lunch, a hamburger bun for dinner- or simply toasted with goat cheese and a glass of red wine. In 2015, Susan began baking in her home kitchen and selling at the Charlottesville farmer&rsquo;s market. In late 2017 Orange Dot moved into a new dedicated, gluten free baking facility, and in 2019 won Local Food Hub's Entrepreneur of the Year Award.</p>
