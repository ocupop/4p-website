          <p><a href="https://www.papaweaver.com/">Papa Weaver&rsquo;s Pork</a> is a family-owned and operated business in Madison County, Virginia, owned by Tina and Tom Weaver. The farm (formerly owned by President James Madison) has been in their family for seven generations, throughout which time pigs have always been a staple.</p>
          <p>The Weavers have spent years building their reputation through careful focus on local foods and producing a hand-raised, all-natural pork product. They raise their animals with homegrown feed, fresh air, proper nutrition, and a healthy environment. By having control of the quality of feed, genetics, and a safe healthy environment, they can guarantee a product that is safe, healthy, and extremely delicious.</p>
          <p>The animals receive no growth hormones, and they work with a humane, USDA inspected, high-capacity butcher to process their animals into high-quality cuts and a variety of flavorful sausages. Papa Weaver's Pork sells their products locally through retailers and wholesalers, including 4P Foods, local stores, and local restaurants.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Papa Weaver's Pork is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
