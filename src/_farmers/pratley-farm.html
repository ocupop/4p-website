          <p>Thomas Pratley and Phyllis Montellese moved to a 100- year- old farmhouse in Fluvanna County in 2008 to pursue their dream of owning a small farm. When not out working the land, Phyllis is a family physician and Thomas is a Fluvanna County representative to the Thomas Jefferson soil and water district. On their 12 acre property, they have a bountiful market garden where they focus on growing their produce with responsible, organic methods.</p>
          <p>In addition to produce, they raise Boer goats and have two flocks of free-range chickens. Their hens spend their days in the yard enjoying insects, and are fed a healthy diet of premium layer ration and other supplements so that they produce delicious brown eggs on a consistent basis.</p>
          <p>Pratley Farm is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
