  At Red House Grove, purpose thrives in every branch and blossom. This 21‑acre
  specialty fruit farm nurtures rare and regional gems—five varieties of plums
  (including the elusive Santa Rosa), seven heirloom pears like Seckel and
  Winter Nelis, plus figs, peaches, and apples—celebrating biodiversity and
  flavor outside the commercial mainstream.
