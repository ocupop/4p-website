          <h5>What’s so special about Santa Rosa plums?</h5>
          <p>Developed in the early 1900s by horticulturist Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa plums are a classic California variety prized for their rich, sweet-tart flavor, ruby skin, and amber flesh. Their juicy, complex taste and floral aroma make them a favorite for fresh eating—but they also shine in jams, sauces, and baked goods. While large-scale farms moved away from them due to their delicate skin and shorter shelf life, farms like Red House Grove keep this beloved variety alive for one simple reason: they’re absolutely delicious.</p>
