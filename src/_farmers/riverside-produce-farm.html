          <p>Luke and Stacey Hallman recently moved to Virginia from southern Maryland, where they had farmed for seven years. They&rsquo;ve purchased 22 acres outside of Richmond and are building their farm from the ground up. They currently have eight acres in production, with plans to expand to 13-15 acres of vegetable production and six acres of orchards (peaches and pears).</p>
          <p>They follow low-spray practices, using natural and organic inputs as much as possible, and keep bees on their land to help with pollination and to develop healthy fruits. Luke holds a B.S. in horticulture from Penn State, which has come in handy as he grows his vegetable production and refines his growing methods.</p>
          <p>In July 2016, Riverside delivered 7,200 POUNDS OF WATERMELON to Local Food Hub in one delivery!</p>
          <p>Riverside Produce Farm is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
