          <p>Luke and Stacey Hallman moved to Virginia from southern Maryland, where they had farmed for seven years. Theyâ€™ve purchased 22 acres outside of Richmond and built their farm from the ground up. </p>
          <p>They follow low-spray practices, using natural and organic inputs as much as possible, and keep bees on their land to help with pollination and to develop healthy fruits. Luke holds a B.S. in horticulture from Penn State, which has come in handy as he increases his fruit and vegetable production and refines his growing methods.</p>
          <p>4P Foods mainly sources various types of melons from Riverside Produce Farm including canary melons, orange watermelons, yellow doll watermelons, red seedless watermelons, and honeydew melons.</p>
