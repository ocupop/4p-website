          <p>Certified Organic, Virginia Green Travel Certified, Good Agricultural Practices Certified&hellip;Riverstone Organic Farm is certifiably amazing! A crew of experienced farmers cultivates 14 acres of vegetables and fruits, including greenhouse and high tunnel spaces.</p>
          <p>In addition to wholesale production for 4P Foods, Local Food Hub, and other distributor partners in North Carolina and Virginia, Riverstone sells at various farmers markets and hosts its own on-site farm store. Visitors to the farm can choose from produce, meat, herbs, and flowers, and enjoy a walk, a picnic, or a farm tour. If you&rsquo;re ever in Floyd County, consider this a must-see.</p>
          <p>At 2,000+ feet in altitude, Riverstone has a completely different microclimate than Charlottesville and other points in the east. Growers near Richmond may be experiencing tomato-popping rain or hail storms while Riverstone&rsquo;s heirlooms come in smelling like sunshine! Their later spring and cooler summer provides us with a great partner in stretching the season of each item we carry, so that romaine lettuce might stretch through August and fall carrots might stretch until Thanksgiving.</p>
