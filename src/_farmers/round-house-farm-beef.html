  Brothers Zachary and Daryl Morse are third generation cattle ranchers and
  farmers. They have been working with cattle since they were young teenagers
  and in 2019 were able to purchase 200+ acres in Arrington, Virginia, where
  their Black Angus cattle roam and feed off the grass and high quality grain. 


  What keeps them going? Good work ethic and education for the younger
  generation of farmers and ranchers.

          Daryl and Zachary have been farming since they were about 13 years old. As third generation farmers, farming is in their blood. Now at 65 years old, Zachary and his brother run a 200+ acre cattle ranch in Arrington, Virginia. As teenagers, they would travel to Connecticut and work the fields to make money. They would then come back home and reinvest their money in baby calves, which they bottle fed and raised. Among other things - they’d pick up aluminum cans on the side of the road for extra money, going extra early in the mornings so their classmates wouldn’t see them.<p></p>
                     <p>After being discriminated against by the USDA for a small loan, Zachary took a 10 year hiatus from farming. He started and still has a successful landscaping business. One day, his brother called him and told him their neighbors were selling their land and they wanted them to be able to buy it. Zachary toured the land with his brother and the visions came and he knew he had to come back to cattle ranching. Since then, he and his brother are proud to own 200 acres and to run a successful cattle ranch. They are grateful for the opportunity that 4P Foods has given them and look forward to serving the community with their beef products.</p>
