          <p>Using organic, non-GMO seeds, Schuyler Greens Company grows high-quality greens, year-round in greenhouses &ndash; maintaining an optimal temperature range of 60 &ndash; 70&deg;F. In addition to a forced-air heating system, they have invested in a &ldquo;swamp cooler,&rdquo; a device that cools air through the evaporation of water. This enables Schuyler Greens to grow salad greens in the heat of the summer; something that is difficult if not impossible to do outside in Virginia! The greens are grown hydroponically, a method that grows plants in water rather than in soil. The roots are harvested with the edible leaves of the plant, which helps the greens stay fresh and last longer.</p>
          <p>As of fall 2016, Schuyler Greens Company is pursuing GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) Certification with the help of Local Food Hub. GAP Certification is a government- and industry-recognized standard in food safety and is among the highest regarded credentials available. Because the certification process is challenging and there are high costs associated with compliance, Local Food Hub offers cost-share programs and training for growers interested in becoming GAP certified. This enables us to expand our GAP Certified line of products with more delicious leafy greens!</p>
