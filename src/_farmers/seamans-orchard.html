          <p>Seamans' Orchard is a fourth-generation family farm tucked away in the rolling hills of Nelson County. Specializing in apples, cherries, berries, and pumpkins, the evolution of the farm since its founding in 1933 has been guided by the family’s commitment to “growing only the finest nature will allow.”</p>
          <p>Local Food Hub began working with Seamans’ in 2015 in order to meet customers’ unquenchable appetite for flavorful, summer blueberries. The orchard also maintains pick-your-own opportunities for several of their crops throughout the season in case you want to immerse yourself in the sights, sounds, and smells of the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains while you harvest.</p>
