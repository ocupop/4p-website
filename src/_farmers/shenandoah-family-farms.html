          <p>What could be more satisfying than a cold glass of creamy, fresh milk? At 4P Foods, we partner with local, sustainable dairy producers to ensure your weekly Dairy Bag is overflowing with wholesome goodness.</p>
          <p>We're thrilled to be partnering with Shenandoah Valley Family Farms, a small group of Certified Organic farmers "using old ways in a changing world." These farms are dedicated to responsible stewardship of the planet and the living things and places in their care. &nbsp;Among them is Mountain Branch Creamery in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, a family farm operated by Wayne and Annie Beery.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Since their herds graze on healthy pasture and are never fed grains, the wild grasses, clovers, and other plants in the cows' diets impart subtle flavor notes in the milk which change with the seasons. Mountain Branch Creamery's "cow to carton" milk is processed right on the farm and is high in CLAs, omega 3 fatty acids, and proteins.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Be on the look out for Shenandoah Valley Family Farms Grade A, non-homogenized (cream on top) whole milk in your 4P Dairy bag, available in Organic, A2, and Vat Pasteurized options. It's real, local, 100% grass-fed milk without GMOs or growth hormones.</p>
          <p>We hope to offer more options like chocolate milk and 2% milk from Shenandoah Valley Family Farms in the future.</p>
          <h3><strong>More on Milk</strong></h3>
          <p><strong>Non-Homogenized</strong></p>
          <p>Non-homogenized or "creamline" milk is that which has natural fat molecules, or cream, that have not been removed through the homogenization process. You can skim the cream off with a spoon, and it's delicious in coffee, Thai iced tea, or over fresh fruit. But you can also simply shake the bottle to blend it before use. Separation into milk and cream will reoccur as the milk settles.</p>
          <p><strong>Pasteurization</strong></p>
          <p>By law, all milk sold in the state of VA must be pasteurized. This process heats the milk so that potentially harmful bacteria are destroyed but the product's quality and nutritional content are preserved. Specific methods include high temperature short time (HTST) and low temperature long time (LTLT) or vat/batch pasteurization.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>A2 Milk</strong></p>
          <p>A2 milk contains a different type of beta-casein protein than typical cow's milk, which contains the A1 beta-casein protein. A2 protein makes A2 cow's milk structurally similar to goat, sheep, and buffalo milk. Some sources suggest that A2 milk is easier to digest and absorb than A1 milk and may have additional health benefits.</p>
