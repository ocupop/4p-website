          <p>What could be more satisfying than a cold glass of creamy, fresh milk? At 4P Foods, we partner with local, sustainable dairy producers like Shenandoah Valley Family Farms to ensure your weekly Dairy Bag is overflowing with wholesome goodness.</p>
          <p>Shenandoah Valley Family Farms's non-homogenized (cream on top) whole milk is now available in Organic, A2, and Vat Pasteurized options. They hope to offer more options like chocolate milk and even 2% milk in future 4P Dairy Bags.</p>
          <p><strong>More on Milk</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Non-Homogenized</strong></p>
          <p>Non-homogenized milk is that which has natural fat molecules, or cream, that have not been removed through the homogenization process. You can skim the cream off with a spoon, and it's delicious in coffee, Thai iced tea, or over fresh fruit. But you can also simply shake the bottle to blend it before use. Separation into milk and cream will reoccur as the milk settles.</p>
          <p><strong>Pasteurization</strong></p>
          <p>By law, all milk sold in the state of VA must be pasteurized. This process heats the milk so that potentially harmful bacteria are destroyed but the product's quality and nutritional content are preserved. Specific methods include high temperature short time (HTST) and low temperature long time (LTLT) or vat/batch pasteurization.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>A2 Milk</strong></p>
          <p>A2 milk contains a different type of beta-casein protein than typical cow's milk, which contains the A1 beta-casein protein. A2 protein make A2 cow's milk structurally similar to goat, sheep, and buffalo milk. Some sources suggest that A2 milk is easier to digest&nbsp; and absorb than A1 milk and may have additional health benefits.</p>
