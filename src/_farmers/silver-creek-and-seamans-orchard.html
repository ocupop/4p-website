          <p>In 1959 Silver Creek Packing Shed was started as a packing facility for Silver Creek Orchards and Lea &amp; Seaman Orchard. The founding families were John T. Morton of Silver Creek Orchards and Alton R. Seaman and Joyce Seaman of Lea &amp; Seaman Orchard.</p>
          <p>In 2012, the Silver Creek Packing Shed was renamed Silver Creek &amp; Seamans’ Orchards, Inc. The owners wanted to incorporate both orchard names in the name of the packing facility.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Today, John and Ruth Saunders, Richard Seaman, and Anne Kidd run the operations at Silver Creek &amp; Seamans’ Orchards, Inc.&nbsp;</p>
