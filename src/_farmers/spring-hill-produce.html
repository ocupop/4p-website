          <p><a href="https://www.lewistaylorfarms.com/spring-hill-produce">Spring Hill Produce</a> is a partnering food hub based in Tifton, GA. They specialize in the packing and distribution of melons, broccoli, cabbage, and greens grown by their partner farms in Georgia, the Carolinas, Florida, and Indiana.</p>
          <p>Spring Hill Produce operates under rigorous food safety standards. They have a cutting-edge facility with Hydro Cooler, slusher, and clam shell ice machines that allow them to rapidly cool produce, a critical quality control step during the hottest part of the growing season.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We began featuring Spring Hill Produce melons in July 2020, and we're excited that our regional partnership model allows 4P Foods to offer you a fresh taste of summer from our southern neighbors.&nbsp;</p>
