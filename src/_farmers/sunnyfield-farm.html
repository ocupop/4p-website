          <p>Marina and Petr Dronov immigrated to the United States from Russia, settling in the Harrisonburg area in order to be near extended family. While Petr put his skills to use in the construction industry and Marina devoted her time to tending to a growing family, they also ventured into farming on leased land as a way to connect with the agricultural life they left behind in Russia.</p>
          <p>Soon after, they began working with Local Food Hub to distribute their peppers, tomatoes, and melons. In 2015, they purchased property and began building their farm. Along the way, they decided that they really like to grow bell peppers!</p>
          <p>Sunnyfield Farm is GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) Certified and in 2015, they were awarded Local Food Hub's Pioneer in the Field Award.
