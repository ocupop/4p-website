          <p>There&rsquo;s something about Hugh French that draws you in. &nbsp;It could be his warm, bashful smile. &nbsp;Perhaps it&rsquo;s the fact that he is such a great host to people visiting his farm and gets joy out of showing them around &ndash; zipping from one field to the next on his &ldquo;scooter,&rdquo; as he calls it (I knew it as a quad or ATV growing up, but they are definitely going to be scooters from now on). &nbsp;For me, Hugh won me over when we took a detour from the farm to his front yard so that Amber could snap some pictures of his wife (Anita&rsquo;s) lovely flowers near their driveway. &nbsp;I could tell that Anita loved her petunias, but Hugh loved her even more. &nbsp;If that&rsquo;s the type of warmth going into my vegetables that he&rsquo;s growing &hellip; sign me up.</p>

          <p>Hugh French is a fifth generation farmer. &nbsp;He and his family own Sunnyside Farms in Cumberland, VA, about 150 miles southwest of Washington, DC. &nbsp;His four sons and eleven grandkids all live on the farm that is made up of 120 overflowing acres of vegetables. &nbsp;Their operation is a family affair. &nbsp;Three of his sons all work with him, and one grandson is particularly interested in the future of farming &ndash; it looks like the 6th and 7th generation of Sunnyside Farm are in the works. &nbsp;We sure hope so &hellip; though it wasn&rsquo;t long ago that Sunnyside almost didn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
          <p>Mr. French and his family used to be hog farmers. &nbsp;They raised pork, and a lot of it. &nbsp;By Hugh&rsquo;s last count, they had over 1200 pigs roaming their farm. &nbsp;Unfortunately though, Hugh was farming in a transitional period of agriculture here in the US that has been, arguably, the worst thing that could have happened to our food system. &nbsp;From the early 1970&rsquo;s through the early 2000&rsquo;s, farming became a &ldquo;get big or get out&rdquo; commodity business. &nbsp;It was during this time period that we lost the vast majority of small family farms to large agribusiness goliaths. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The French family was close to becoming part of that story: &nbsp;In the early 90&rsquo;s, Smithfield was the nation&rsquo;s largest pork processor and distributor (it is now owned by a Chinese agribusiness, state-owned company and is the largest in the world). &nbsp;The influence Smithfield was able to impose on the local markets forced Hugh to make a decision that would affect his farm, and all of the future generations that depended on it: &nbsp;Sell pigs as part of Smithfield&rsquo;s operation (and lose all autonomy and control of his own farm), or, do something else. &nbsp;Hugh chose the latter. &nbsp;That something else? &nbsp;Vegetables. &nbsp;Lots and lots of incredible vegetables.</p>

          <p>Today, almost twenty years later, Sunnyside Farms is a thriving vegetable farm. &nbsp;They grow cantaloupe, sweet corn, eggplant, multiple watermelon varieties, endless squash, okra, and forty (yes, 40) different types of tomatoes and peppers. &nbsp;His teardrop cherry tomatoes are a sugar cube turned into a bursting gobstopper of deliciousness in your mouth. &nbsp;If you ever tour his farm with him on his scooter, he&rsquo;ll make sure you try one, or two, or ten.</p>
          <p>Farm boy French (part of his email handle) is one of the best, and kindest farmers we have had the opportunity of getting to know. &nbsp;You will likely see much of his produce in your 4P Foods bags throughout the Spring and Summer months. &nbsp;Know that when you do, you&rsquo;re supporting an amazing family, the 45 people that live and work on the farm, a story that goes back many generations, and with your help, will continue for many generations to come.</p>
          <p>Three cheers for Hugh and Anita French, their family, and their story. &nbsp;I learned a lot from my short visit with Hugh, but the biggest lesson I took away is this: &nbsp;Be sure to always take time to stop and smell the flowers. &nbsp;Especially if they&rsquo;re your wife&rsquo;s petunias.</p>
