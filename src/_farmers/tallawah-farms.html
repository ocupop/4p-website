          <p>Tallawah Farms on the Eastern Shore of Maryland is a group of growers native to the Caribbean. Black-owned and family-operated, their motto is "eat what you grow, and grow what you eat," and farming is very much their way of life.</p>
          <p>Using sustainable practices on their 1.5-acre property, they specialize in ethnic crops from the Caribbean islands, including hot peppers, okra, and callaloo, plus cucumbers, sweet peppers, and more.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Their name comes from a Jamaican term used to describe someone or something as strong, fearless, and not to be underestimated - and that captures the spirit and pride upheld by Tallawah Farms growers.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Tallawah's red habanero peppers and lush callaloo greens have been spicing up our Produce Bags, and we love it! These unique veggies provide migrants with a taste of home while introducing something new and different to our community.&nbsp;</p>
