          <p>The Homestead Oven started in Ryan Lee's home kitchen in Charlottesville, Virginia. Ryan baked gluten-free sourdough breads for family and friends each week, and as demand grew, he began offering a selection of breads at the local farmers market. After a successful year, The Homestead Oven outgrew its home kitchen, and with the help of the community, moved into a brick and mortar production space in town.</p>
          <p>Their gluten-free bread is made with organic grains- including millet, buckwheat, and oat- as well as other flours that are organic as much as possible, depending on the loaf. The bakery stone-mills most of its grains fresh for each week of baking, which preserves as many of the nutritional benefits as possible and creates the most flavorful flour. Each loaf is naturally leavened with their trusty sourdough culture, which imparts a satisfying depth of flavor and all the benefits that slow-fermented, naturally leavened bread can provide.</p>
