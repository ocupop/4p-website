          <p><strong>Please note that the Rock Barn is no longer in operation.</strong></p>
          <p>The Rock Barn was Nelson County&rsquo;s renowned custom pork butchery. Ben Thompson, a former United States Navy cook aboard the USS Hampton, served as chef-butcher-owner of the Rock Barn. While deployed, Benjamin was exposed to cuisine from everywhere from the North Pole to the Mediterranean and he learned invaluable lessons on how food creates morale and fellowship. He shared these lessons and experiences through his craft butchery where respect for people and animals was key and the highest quality product and workmanship was celebrated.</p>
          <p>Thompson created The Rock Barn to be a whole hog butcher that focuses on the craft of butchery by being good representatives of the animals that they process and the farmers who raised them. The Rock Barn aspired to strengthen the connection between the things we eat and the fields from which they come by showing consumers their practices and hopefully getting consumers to question the sources of other foods in their lives. Their mission was to create food that honestly expresses local flavor, keeping foods as close to their heritage as possible.</p>
          <p>The Rock Barn employed a four-man crew who upheld the guiding principle that a respectful butcher finds uses for the entire pig. It helps when you connect with the living creature that was sacrificed knowing that nothing will go to waste. Respect for the materials, for the art, is paramount. And using every part of the animal is a keystone of that philosophy.</p>
          <p>Many of the hogs used by The Rock Barn came from Timbercreek Farm in Charlottesville&mdash;Rock Barn&rsquo;s primary source, although they also purchased from other farmers. The hogs were slaughtered just a short distance away at T&amp;E Meats in Harrisonburg &ndash; co-owned by the famous &ldquo;Beyond Organic&rdquo; Farmer Joel Salatin.</p>
          <p>The Rock Barn sought to offer an alternative to the factory farm, commodity slaughterhouse, and plastic wrapper grocery chain system that disconnects the consumer with the pork chop and the pig. It was their mission to bring back some of the traditional meat culture that factory farms are unable to mass produce and therefore, most Americans have learned to live without. It was an honor to partner with The Rock Barn to share their exceptional pork products with you.&nbsp;</p>
