          <p><a href="https://www.theresamfarmgroup.com/">Theresam Farm Group LLC </a>in Prince George's County, MD is a social enterprise founded by Ergibe Boyd, a retired U.S. diplomat who worked in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. She followed her lifelong dream to pursue agriculture after her retirement, and began growing vegetables on more than 22 acres.</p>
          <p>The farm's specialties are African heritage produce, including things you may have heard of like callaloo (amaranth greens) and many you may not be familiar with, like bitter leaf, huckleberry leaf, jute leaf, potato leaf, and more. Theresam also produces several varieties of hot peppers, kale, tomatoes, squashes, and watermelon - and raw honey, too.</p>
          <p>A portion of the proceeds from Theresam Farm Group LLC sales go to Ms. Boyd's One Child at a Time project, which aims to help socioeconomically disadvantaged youth aged 15-19 gain employment and educational opportunities. The program provides jobs to finance education and training as well as a Scholarship Fund.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We've had the pleasure of offering Theresam's huckleberries and their unique and beautiful sweet potato greens. We look forward to continue working with them to provide something different and delicious in your Produce Bag.&nbsp;</p>
