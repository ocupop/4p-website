          <p>Virginia's Shenandoah Valley is known for its rich, agricultural land and skillful farmers – many of whom can trace their agricultural heritage back through several generations. Clifford Rohrer and his family have been farming for over 30 years on land that was originally settled by their family in 1876. Three generations currently work together to perform the diverse tasks required to produce and market over 20 acres of produce within a larger diversified farm operation. They are well known in the community for providing guidance to up-and-coming farmers, their investment in on-farm food safety practices, and for the high quality of their crops – primarily potatoes, onions, and winter squash.</p>
