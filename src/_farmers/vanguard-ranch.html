          <p>Renard and Chinette Turner of <a href="https://vanguard-ranch-natural-gourmet.ueniweb.com/#header">Vanguard Ranch Natural Gourmet</a>&nbsp;in Orange County, VA believe that "farming is an act of liberation." Seeking a more sustainable, self-sufficient lifestyle, they left D.C. and moved to the countryside to start their farm in 1995.</p>
          <p>The Turners grow organic heirloom vegetables and herbs, and breed and raise meat goats and squabs - domestic pigeons with rich, delicate meat like the dark meat of chicken.&nbsp; Vanguard Ranch animals are tended naturally and allowed to range freely, resulting in high-quality, delicious products like their famous goat burgers and kabobs.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We partnered with Vanguard Ranch through our Equitable Food Sourcing Initiative to help support emerging black farmers by connecting them to community members ready to try what they're growing. Be on the lookout for Vanguard Ranch's offerings in your 4P Bags to come.&nbsp;</p>
