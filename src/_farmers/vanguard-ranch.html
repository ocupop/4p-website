          <p>Renard and Chinette Turner of <a href="https://vanguard-ranch-natural-gourmet.ueniweb.com/#header">Vanguard Ranch Natural Gourmet</a>&nbsp;in Lousia County, VA believe that "farming is an act of liberation." Seeking a more sustainable, self-sufficient lifestyle, they left D.C. and moved to the countryside to start their farm in 1995.</p>
          <p>Vanguard Ranch Ltd. is a small diversified, sustainable, and organic family farm. Owned by husband and wife Renard and Chinette Turner and assisted by Richard Yates (all senior citizens!), they are committed to providing the highest quality organically grown product and food products. Certified Naturally Grown, the Turners grow organic heirloom vegetables and herbs, and breed and raise myotonic (fainting) meat goats and have developed their own line called Bangus.</p>
          <p>They also raise squabs - domestic pigeons with rich, delicate meat like the dark meat of chicken.&nbsp; Vanguard Ranch animals are tended naturally and allowed to range freely, resulting in high-quality, delicious products like their famous goat burgers and kabobs.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Vanguard Ranch's "A Taste of Africa" is an on-farm production growing vegetables well-known in African cuisines. They look forward to working with 4P Foods in this exciting new adventure.</p>
          <p>We partnered with Vanguard Ranch through our Equitable Food Sourcing Initiative to help support emerging black farmers by connecting them to community members ready to try what they're growing. Be on the lookout for Vanguard Ranch's unique offerings in your 4P Bags to come.&nbsp;</p>
