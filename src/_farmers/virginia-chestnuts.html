          <p>Virginia Chestnuts is a family-owned and operated orchard, with deep roots in Nelson County. David and Kim Bryant were both born into farming families, providing them with a strong background to establish and manage an orchard. David learned about fruit orchards from his father, and his wife Kim is a long-time year-round gardener. They established their chestnut orchard in 2009, and in 2012 began a chestnut growers group of five chestnut orchards. The group shares tips with one another, enabling them to provide the best quality chestnuts at the time when customers need them most: late fall into early winter.</p>

          <p>Virginia Chestnuts are water cured, a method that enhances flavor and preserves freshness. They taste great roasted over the fire, used in stuffing, made into soup, or eaten raw.</p>
