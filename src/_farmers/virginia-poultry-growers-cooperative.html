          <p>Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative (VPGC) was incorporated in the summer of 2004. However, the farmers that make up the cooperative have been growing turkeys for decades. From the farm to the finished product, VPGC is committed to producing an exceptional product.</p>
          <p>VPGC is located in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley with their processing plant in Hinton, VA a feed mill in Broadway, VA, and a Grain Unloading Site in Harrisonburg, VA. This area is known for poultry, particularly turkeys. They have farms spread throughout the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
          <p>VPGC is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
