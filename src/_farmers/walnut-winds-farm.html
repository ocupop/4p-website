          <p>After retiring from a career in the military, Delmer Livengood Sr. began Walnut Winds Farm in Pittsylvania County, VA. Drawing on his early study in agriculture at West Virginia University, he established a produce farm that specialized in cantaloupes. Delmer raised a family on the farm and spent many long days cultivating, harvesting, and selling melons with his son, DJ.</p>
          <p>As DJ grew up and Delmer looked to take a step away from the fields, DJ took over management of the farm and began transitioning the land to a diversified produce operation. He purchased land adjacent to their farm to expand the operation, and enlisted help from the whole family. Delmer and DJ&rsquo;s mom continues to help out on the farm, and DJ&rsquo;s wife Melanie handles bookkeeping and marketing, among other farm duties. The Livengood&rsquo;s goal is to grow their business so that everyone in the family can work full-time on the farm. With DJ&rsquo;s keep knowledge of farming and commitment to innovation, they are taking impressive steps towards that goal each year.</p>
          <p>Walnut Winds Farm began working with Local Food Hub (LFH) in 2012, quickly becoming an anchor producer and enabling LFH to expand their partnerships with large-volume customers. Walnut Winds specializes in tomatoes, bell peppers, asparagus, broccoli, sweet potatoes, and more, which can be found at area farmers' markets in addition to 4P Foods orders. In 2014, Walnut Winds Farm was recognized as LFH's Partner Producer of the Year, which honors farming families who excel at consistently and reliably delivering local produce packed in accordance with the highest standards.</p>
