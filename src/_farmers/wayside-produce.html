          <p>If asked what's available from Wayside Produce, father and son duo Alex and Andrew Mason will respond in unison, &ldquo;Name a crop.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>That&rsquo;s the same &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; mentality that brought the Masons to Virginia to begin a new family adventure in Rockingham County. Alex was originally an organic landscaper in New York City, but his strong passion for stewarding the land, coupled with his love for fresh, nutritious food, led him to a lifestyle and career shift in 2009.</p>
          <p>In what might have been an otherwise daunting experience, Alex was thrilled when his son, Andrew, and wife, Elda, agreed to join the journey and move 350 miles south to rural Virginia. After just a few years in the countryside working the land, you would never guess this family had not been doing this their whole lives!</p>

          <p>The Masons began their partnership with Local Food Hub (LFH) in 2013, and LFH has had great fun getting to know this hardworking and dynamic family. In addition to 4P Foods weekly offerings, you can find Wayside Produce - which includes Asian greens, tatsoi, beets, sweet corn, melons, asparagus, and just about every berry you can think of - at the Broadway and Harrisonburg Farmers Markets, Harrisonburg, Staunton, and Charlottesville restaurants, and at Integral Yoga Natural Foods. If that isn&rsquo;t enough, visit their farmstand Tuesday through Saturday from the end of April until the end of November.</p>
          <p>Wayside Produce is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
