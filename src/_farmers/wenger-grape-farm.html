          <p>The Wenger family has been growing grapes in the Shenandoah Valley since before the Civil War. Today, Dave and Mim Wenger continue the family tradition at Wenger Grape Farms in Augusta County with the help of their daughter Wendy, and her husband, Mark Hochstedler. Wendy&rsquo;s grandparents, the late Paul &amp; Martha Wenger, began farming at the current location in 1938, where they primarily raise Concord and Niagara table grapes.</p>
          <p>Now in the third generation of Wenger farmers, the tradition continues of growing some of the best grapes we&rsquo;ve ever tasted! With peak harvest times beginning in early September and lasting for just six weeks, the Wengers take full advantage by offering a pick-your-own experience on the farm, and sell to local retailers and wholesalers, at the Charlottesville City Market, and to wineries throughout the state.</p>
          <p>The Wengers began working with Local Food Hub in 2013, and in 2014 won their Pioneer in the Field Award, which recognizes a Virginia farmer who has demonstrated innovation in food system development through their work with Local Food Hub. The Wenger&rsquo;s grapes are a customer and staff favorite, and their arrival is eagerly awaited each late summer or early fall!</p>
          <p>Wenger Grape Farm is a Local Food Hub partner farm. We are proud to partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;to connect small family farmers in Virginia to 4P FOODS customers.</p>
