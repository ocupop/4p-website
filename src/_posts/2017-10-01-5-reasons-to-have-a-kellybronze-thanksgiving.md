<div class="editable"><p>The New York Times called it "the Rolls Royce of turkeys."&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kellybronze.com/jamie-oliver.aspx">Jamie Oliver</a>, renowned British chef and food activist, said "KellyBronze turkeys are the best of the best, the most joyful treat." So why should you pre-order one of these luxuriously grown birds for your Thanksgiving feast?</p><p>1.<strong>&nbsp;These turkeys are raised on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kellybronze.com/kellybronze-free-range-turkeys-home.aspx">a family farm</a>&nbsp;who have been producing the best turkeys for over 30 years now.</strong></p><p><img src="/uploads/kelly-bronze-kelly-man-e1476217939438.jpg" width="770" height="529" /></p><p>The Kelly family has produced turkeys since 1971 when the founders Derek and Molly Kelly decided to start producing top quality turkeys in Danbury, England. In 1983 Derek Kelly travelled the UK collecting the last remaining flocks of pure bronze turkeys from Scotland, Wales, and England. This was the start of Kelly Bronze, now moving into its third generation as a family business. Paul Kelly (son of Derek and Molly Kelly) started work on the farm in 1984. Over the years, he wanted to start the unique artisan method of turkey farming in the US but could not find the right farm or partner. That changed in 2012 after meeting Judd Culver and the rest of the Culver family, and he started raising high quality, artisanal turkeys on Heritage Glen farm in Crozet, VA.</p><p>2.&nbsp;<strong>The birds live as nature intended, on 100 acres of turkey paradise in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img src="/uploads/kb2.jpg" width="770" height="512" /></p><p>The farm is perfect for raising turkeys, with sixteen acres of flat pasture and trees in the front of the farm to raise the turkeys when young in the late spring and early summer. They can then be moved onto fresh ground further up the mountain in late summer and into fall. The turkeys are then walked to the processing unit at the beginning of November to be plucked and dry aged before the winter weather sets in. This timeframe allows for natural maturation and slow growth.</p><p>3.&nbsp;<strong>These turkeys are the most delicious out there due to their natural growing process and maturity.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img src="/uploads/kb3.jpg" width="770" height="512" /></p><p>At harvest, these turkeys are twice of a conventionally raised turkey. By allowing them to grow to the equivalent of adult age, they develop a beautifully marbled layer of natural fat, and mature carcass and bone - all essential ingredients for award-winning flavour and natural gravy stock.</p><p>4.&nbsp;<strong>The turkeys are plucked by hand and hung to dry age for even more tender and flavorful meat.</strong></p><p><img src="/uploads/kb4.png" width="770" height="254" /></p><p>The birds are hand-plucked on the farm when they are mature and ready to eat - and not when they reach a particular weight. Little black feather quills can be seen in the skin - a detail that has become a defining Kelly Bronze hallmark. Because the birds are hand plucked by the Kelly family, they can take the extra time to hang the turkeys, allowing the birds to age the traditional way, intensifying the flavors and tenderizing the meat - both labor intensive and time consuming methods that give award-winning results.</p><p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Due to the high quality of the turkey and excellent marbling of the meat, the Kelly Bronze Turkey cooks twice as fast as a regular turkey.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><img src="/uploads/kb5.jpg" width="770" height="513" /></strong></p><p>No, your eyes do not deceive you. KellyBronze turkeys cook in half of the time of the average bird. Complimentary with your turkey comes a meat thermometer as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kellybronze.co.uk/how-to-cook-a-kelly-bronze-turkey">cooking instructions</a>, so you can properly cook your best turkey yet.
