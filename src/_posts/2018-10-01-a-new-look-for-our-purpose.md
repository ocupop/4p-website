<div class="editable"><p>As we welcome the changing season, we are excited to announce news of changes here at 4P FOODS. Over the past four years, 4P FOODS has evolved its services as a food hub&nbsp;<a href="http://4pfoods.com/about-us/">social enterprise.</a>&nbsp;Now we are enhancing our visual identity to match our mission.</p><p>We value your feedback and we know how important it is to live your values through your food - by supporting your local economy and food equity in your community. That's why we decided to make the process of shopping for your 4P bags even easier. We are&nbsp; excited to announce that we are in the process of rebranding and remodeling our website.</p><p>What you will see is a ripple of transformation. The talented team at&nbsp;<a href="https://ocupop.com/">Occupop Creative Agency</a>&nbsp;have created our new look that visually celebrates 4P FOODS and helps tell our story. First, you will see a new logo and 4P badge for our online presence. Meanwhile, our behind-the-scenes team is building the framework of our new and improved website. Not to worry, members - things will still work the same around here!</p><p>Thanks for your continued support of our good food community.</p><p>Peas and love,</p><p>Tom &amp; the 4P Team</p><p><img width="4168" height="4167" src="/uploads/4p-foods-cmyk-logo-color-color.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
