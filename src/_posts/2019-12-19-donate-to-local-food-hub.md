<div class="editable"><p>Starting this holiday season, we're very excited to be able to offer our members the option to make a tax-deductible donation to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/about-us/">Local Food Hub</a>&nbsp;(LFH), our partner organization.</p><p>4P members will always have the option to donate their bags, and your kindness is always appreciated! However, our local food bank partners are inundated with food donations this time of the year. Instead, consider donating the cost of your bag (or any dollar amount you choose) to LFH.</p><p>Your contribution will directly support food access programs like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/food-access/">Fresh Farmacy</a>, a Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program that's one of Local Food Hub's several initiatives dedicated to building food equity within our community. Fresh Farmacy empowers community members to make healthy lifestyle choices with cooking classes and much more.</p><p>All LFH donations are 100% tax-deductible, and members can make a one-time or recurring contribution. Click&nbsp;<a href="http://4pfoods.com/partnership-with-local-food-hub/">here</a>&nbsp;for more information about our partnership with Local Food Hub, and visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/4pshare/">this page</a>&nbsp;to learn more about how your generosity will support our shared mission to improve lives by improving the food system.</p></div>
