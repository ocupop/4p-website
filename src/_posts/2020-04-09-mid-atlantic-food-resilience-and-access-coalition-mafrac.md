<div class="editable"><p>Once it became clear that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/covid19/">#COVID19</a>&nbsp;was going to fundamentally change the way we live our lives and threaten the livelihoods of farmers, food businesses, and countless others, things have looked very different at&nbsp;<a href="https://try4pfoods.com/at-home">4P Foods.</a>&nbsp;And not just because we are working extra hard to ensure the safety of our food, customers, and team in the face of this pandemic. We put our mission&mdash;helping small, independent farms thrive, while ensuring that all people have access to Good Food&mdash;into overdrive.</p><p>We raised our hand to help lead a regional response to this crisis, and the diverse coalition that has formed represents everyone from restaurants to farmers, taxi fleets to food banks. At this very moment, 4P Foods,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/about-us/">Local Food Hub</a>, and other members of this coalition are working together and mobilizing to fill gaps in the food system across our region. Together are helping to lead the Mid-Atlantic Food Resilience and Access Coalition,&nbsp;<a href="https://mafrac.com/">MAFRAC.</a></p><p>In this time of unprecedented need, it is more important than ever that we invest in the local food system, both to keep farms and food businesses a viable and stable source of food production and to provide equitable food access to the most vulnerable in our communities. We invite you to stand with us.</p><p><strong>WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p><ul><li>Donate if you can. 4P Foods is seeking $100K for its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/greater-dcva-emergency-food-farm-support">DMV/VA Farms and Food Fund</a>&nbsp;for the immediate expansion of our work supporting farmers and local food access.
