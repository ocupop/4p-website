<div class="editable"><p>It&rsquo;s been three months since we started this GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for our emergency response efforts to feed people through the COVID-19 pandemic, and what a three months they have been. The difficulties that our country and world face as a result of the novel coronavirus and the not-novel disease of systemic racism are not going away anytime soon. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do anything about them, and 4P&rsquo;s commitment to using every available means to advance a more nourishing, equitable food system from farmer to consumer is only just beginning.</p><p>Your support of our fundraising efforts was indispensable to the assistance we have been able to provide to local farms, small businesses, and those in need over the past three months. With your help, we were able to:</p><ul><li>Provide nearly&nbsp; 5,000 meals to community members in need in Fauquier County through our grab-and-go lunch program in partnership with Fauquier Community Child Care</li><li>Support the distribution and coordination of nearly 3,000 hyper-locally sourced and -produced meals thus far through the next evolution of the grab-and-go lunches, Community Cooks, with FCCC and anchor partner Warrenton Wellness Kitchen</li><li>Donate 144 bouquets of locally grown flowers from Wollam Gardens to families picking up food from Oasis Community Partners&rsquo; Pop-Up Food Bank on Easter weekend</li><li>Connect 15 food assistance providers with food from local farmers and producers, creating a positive impact for both people in need and local businesses</li></ul><p>Your support was indispensable to accomplishing all of this and more. In the midst of COVID-19, 4P also led the creation of an entirely new entity, the <a href="/posts/coalition-creates-links-to-feed-be-fed/">Mid-Atlantic Food Resilience and Access Coalition</a> (MAFRAC). MAFRAC&rsquo;s mission is mobilize the Mid-Atlantic Foodshed&rsquo;s resources and assets to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable communities and food-related businesses in the region, and to leverage capital and connections to co-create a regional food system that is more radically equitable, holistically nourishing, sustainably productive, and representatively owned. As founding partner of MAFRAC, 4P is more deeply embedded than ever in the work of building a better food system. If you would like to learn more about MAFRAC, please visit <a href="mafrac.com">mafrac.com</a>.</p><p>As we wind down this fundraiser, we want to say thank you so much for your generous support. If you have the means to make a further gift, we encourage you to consider giving to one of the many incredible BIPOC-led food and farming organizations in the greater DMV, including Dreaming Out Loud, the Green Scheme, Food Talks and Color, Three Part Harmony Farm, The Bladensburg Farm, Soilful City, Black Dirt Farm Collective and regional organizations such as Black Urban Growers, Land Loss Prevention Project, National Black Farmers Association, Northeast Farmers of color Land Trust, Southeastern African American Farmers Organic Network, HEAL Food Alliance, and National Black Food Justice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>With our deepest gratitude</em>,</p><p>Tom + the 4P Foods Family</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
