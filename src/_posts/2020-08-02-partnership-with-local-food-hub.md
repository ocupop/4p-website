<div class="editable">We at 4P Foods have very exciting news that will positively impact our local food system. After months of careful consideration, 4P Foods and Local Food Hub, a non-profit that partners with Virginia farmers to increase community access to food, have finalized a merger of our distribution operations.</div>

<div class="editable">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="editable"><p>This new partnership marries Local Food Hub&rsquo;s strengths in farmer relationships and product knowledge with 4P Foods&rsquo; strengths in logistics, market development, and sales. Our singular focus is creating an even better, more robust system for getting food from our region&rsquo;s small family farms to market, as well as to consumers who might not otherwise enjoy access to healthy, local food.</p><p>To truly impact the way we feed ourselves in this country, we must continually innovate ways to get good food from family farms to market in a more efficient, scalable, cost-effective way. Unique coalitions of nonprofit organizations, for-profit companies, investors and foundations are coming together to break down the barriers to making good food available to everyone. This is one example of that!</p><p>4P Foods was founded in 2014 with the goal of building an equitable food system while connecting good food from sustainable and small farms to customers in the DC-area. Today we remain as dedicated as ever to that goal. We see this partnership with Local Food Hub as an important step in accomplishing our mission - and one giant step closer to building a better food system for all.</p><p><strong>* For more information about Local Food Hub, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.localfoodhub.org/program/distribution/">visit their website</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>* Please view the&nbsp;<a href="http://4pfoods.com/faq-guide-partnership-with-local-food-hub">FAQ GUIDE</a>&nbsp;for answers to general inquiries.</strong></p><p>As always, thanks for your continued support!
