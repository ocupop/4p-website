<div class="editable"><p>You may remember a few weeks ago we were able to add samples from Coexist Coffee into our weekly shares. You may have been wondering, "when did Coexist start selling coffee? I thought they did the bumper stickers?!" Well, you are correct. Coexist got their start as a Charity in the early 2000s with the aim of promoting intercultural and inter religious coexistence across the globe. More recently, they decided to put their ideals into practice by establishing the Coexist Campaign, a Social Enterprise designed to increase understanding and decrease conflict &nbsp;in divided communities worldwide. Now, every item you purchase from Coexist (including Coexist coffee) helps to contribute to communities that are demonstrating these ideals.</p><p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p><p>The Campaign helps create opportunities for people to work and learn together by supporting farming cooperatives that bridge divides in communities affected by conflict. Coexist then buys their product at a fair price and sells it under the Coexist brand. All proceeds from the sales go directly back into the communities through the establishment of schools. These schools are made up of children from diverse ethnic groups, castes and religions and help to bring together not only the children, but also their parents. How about that?! A circle of good that exists based on the economic engine of a strong customer/producer relationship. Sound a little like another company you know?</p><p><strong>The Coffee:</strong></p><p>Coexist coffee is fair trade and made with 100% organic coffee beans grown by a Jewish - Muslim - Christian Cooperative in Uganda. The beans are hand-picked, hand-sorted, and sun-dried giving the roast a bold, dark flavor. All of the coffee sold in the DC market is roasted in Annapolis, MD. As Coexist Coffee expands to new markets they plan to use local roasters for each new market. As I was interviewing Dana from their team, they were all in the car on their way back from visiting a roaster in NYC since they plan to expand to the NYC market soon!</p><p>Just like 4P Foods, Coexist is a small start-up company, with a team of only 4 people. We are so excited to share their product with our subscribers because we feel they fully embody what we hope that good business can and will become in the future. A force for good in our world based on good business principles.</p><p><strong>Here's how you can support the Coexist Campaign:</strong></p><p>1.
