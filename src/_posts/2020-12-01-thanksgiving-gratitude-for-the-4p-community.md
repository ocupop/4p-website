On a day that celebrates good food, family, and gratitude, we want to say thank you— to the hardworking farmers, the resilient food businesses, the tireless food assistance providers, our incredible 4P Family (especially our frontline warehouse and delivery teams), and dedicated customers and supporters like you.

### YOUR FOOD DOLLARS AT WORK

Thanks for trusting us with something as special as the food on your table\! Every purchase you make from us supports a diverse network of regional family farms and artisan producers while providing nutrient-dense food to some of the many people without access due to the inequities in our food system. So far in 2020, 4P Foods has tripled its purchasing from local, small- and mid-sized farmers to $2.5 million. And, thanks to your generous bag donations, over 3,500 families received healthy, fresh, local food through our partnerships with the National Youth Baseball Academy and other community organizations. In the third quarter alone, your support allowed us to donate nearly 3,000 pounds of food to the Fauquier Community Food Bank. (Photo courtesy of 4P partner, Tallawah Farms).

Your food dollars have a real and measurable impact\!
