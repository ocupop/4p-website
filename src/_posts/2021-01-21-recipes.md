As a Functional Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, one of the biggest mistakes I see in clients is their thirst for a quick fix without first examining the primary foundation of their health: digestion. Digestion supports the function of the entire body. Approximately 70-80% of your immune system resides in your digestive tract. When digestion is impaired, it has a negative effect on all other systems and may be an underlying cause of numerous health issues.</p><p>One food to help repair your gut is cabbage. In fact, it is so great for you it created its own &ldquo;vitamin&rdquo;: Vitamin U. It is not a true vitamin, but a derivative of the essential amino acid: methionine.&nbsp; A doctor in the 1950s coined the term after discovering the nutrients in raw cabbage juice proved to repair peptic ulcers (U for ulcer!) and cells in the gut lining. Ready to fall in love with cabbage this season? Try this recipe to kickstart your health goals!</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>1 pkg Farmer Focus Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast</li><li>1 quart chicken bone broth&nbsp;</li><li>1 leek, sliced</li><li>2 carrots, cut into 1 in. pieces</li><li>1 green cabbage, sliced into 1 in pieces (Napa Cabbage &amp; Bok Choy are suitable substitutes)&nbsp;</li><li>2 tsp ginger&nbsp;</li><li>1 tsp crushed red pepper&nbsp;</li><li>2 cloves minced garlic&nbsp;</li><li>1 tsp sea salt&nbsp;</li><li>Thai chili sauce (optional, to top)</li><li>Egg noodles (optional)</li></ul><h3><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></h3><ol><li>Place chicken breasts and broth into a stockpot or Dutch oven. Bring to a boil and let simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the broth and set aside to cool.&nbsp;</li><li>Put the leeks, carrots, garlic, and spices into the pot <em>uncovered</em> and simmer for 10 minutes, or until tender.&nbsp;</li><li>Shred the cooled chicken into bite sized pieces and return it to the pot. Add the cabbage and noodles (optional) and cook another 5 minutes.

Many of us hold tight to our families' holiday traditions, especially when it comes to food. In December we asked you to share your ultimate cozy comfort food or best holiday-inspired dish. The winner of December's 4P Foodies recipe contest is the hearty and flavorful <em>Pumpkin Spice Pasta</em> by 4P member, Mike K. from Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3><ul><li>Virginia Bison Co. Bison Bourbon Fennel Sausage (or mild/sweet sausage of your choice)</li><li>White onion</li><li>Cooking oil</li><li>Pasta of your choice</li><li>Salt&nbsp;</li><li>8 oz (half a can) of pureed&nbsp;</li><li>8 oz Milk&nbsp;</li><li>Ground nutmeg</li><li>Ground ground clove</li><li>Ground cinnamon</li><li>ground ginger</li><li>Ground onion powder</li><li>&nbsp;Garlic powder&nbsp;</li><li>Ground Gochugaru</li><li>Asparagus</li><li>Grated parmigiano reggiano&nbsp;</li><li>Toasted nuts (for garnish)</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3><p>Start some generously salted water boiling in a pot. Saut&eacute; 0.5-0.75 lb of loose mild or sweet sausage of your choice and about a third of a white onion (roughly chopped) until the onion is soft and meat is cooked or browned to your liking. Remove from the pan and discard excess oil. I used bison bourbon fennel sausage. In an empty pan, add asparagus cut into 1.5" segments, along with oil if necessary. Saut&eacute; until finished and remove from the pan. Meanwhile, add a pasta of your choice to the water and continue to boil. Short pasta (e.g. ziti) works best, but any will do. Boil until done. Put about 8 oz (half a can) of pureed to the pan, now on medium. Once warm, add about 8 oz milk (I used whole milk) and stir until mixed. Bring to a simmer. Add your pumpkin spices to taste. I used freshly ground nutmeg, ground clove, cinnamon, and ginger, along with salt, onion powder, garlic powder and gochugaru. Continue simmering until desired sauce thickness is achieved. Remember, it will tighten as it cools. Once sauce is done, add sausage mixture, asparagus, grated parmigiano reggiano, and pasta, and toss until homogeneous. Spoon into a wide bowl and sprinkle with roughly chopped toasted hazelnuts or pistachios. Enjoy!</p><hr /><h2>BEEF BOURGUIGNON&nbsp;</h2><p>by Luke, 4P Warehouse Guru and Chef</p><p>A well loved stew made with beef that&rsquo;s braised in red wine, (often red Burgundy, hence the name) and beef stock flavored with carrots, onions, garlic, and finished with pearl onions, mushrooms, and bacon. You can use any vegetable you may like but make sure you cook it separately and less fat. For a quicker preparation, you may opt to use a packaged beef broth or beef stock, although we recommend making your own for the aroma and flavors! This recipe is suitable for any lean, tough, boneless beef cut&mdash; Top or Bottom Round, Chuck Roast, Arm&nbsp; Roast, Shanks, and Short Ribs, for example.</p><p>The healthful techniques for this recipe are of refinement. It&rsquo;s important to skim, strain, degrease at every chance you get for a result well worth the effort. The goal is to remove the impurities at every possible opportunity so it won&rsquo;t alter the flavors and dull the sheen of the stew. Lastly, make sure you read the instructions before you begin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Ingredients: RED WINE REDUCTION&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>1 Bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup sliced (1/4 in)Shallots&nbsp;</li><li>1 cup sliced (1/4 in) Mushrooms</li><li>4 Thyme sprigs&nbsp;</li><li>4 Italian Parsley sprigs&nbsp;</li><li>2 Bay leaves&nbsp;</li><li>1 teaspoon whole Black Peppercorn&nbsp;</li><li>2 Garlic cloves, skin left on, smashed&nbsp;</li><li>1 tablespoon of sugar&nbsp;</li><li>1 tablespoon of Beef Demi-Glace (Optional)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Ingredients: MEAT</h3><ul><li>3 pounds of boneless Beef (Round, Chuck Roast, Arm Roast, Shanks or Short Ribs) cut into two-inch cubes</li><li>Kosher Salt and Fresh Black Peppercorn&nbsp;</li><li>Canola oil</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Ingredients: BEEF STOCK REDUCTION&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>1 cup diced Yellow Onion</li><li>1/2 cup diced Carrots</li><li>1 1/2 cup sliced leeks, white and light green parts only&nbsp;</li><li>1 tablespoon Tomato paste&nbsp;</li><li>3 Garlic cloves, skin left on, smashed</li><li>2 Thyme sprigs&nbsp;</li><li>2 Italian Parsley sprigs&nbsp;</li><li>5 cups of Beef Stock</li><li>Red wine reduction&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Ingredients: BACON &amp; MUSHROOMS&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>6 ounces slab bacon or pork belly&nbsp;</li><li>32 small Button mushrooms, cleaned&nbsp;</li><li>2 tablespoon of Butter&nbsp;</li><li>Kosher salt and freshly ground Black Peppercorn&nbsp;</li><li>PEARL ONIONS</li><li>24 red or white Pearl Onions</li><li>1 Bay leaf</li><li>12 Black Peppercorn&nbsp;</li><li>2 Thyme sprigs&nbsp;</li><li>Kosher Salt&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3><p>RED WINE REDUCTION: Combining all the ingredients into a large, bottom heavy stainless steel pot. Bring it to a boil over high heat. Once it is at a boil reduce the heat to a simmer for about 45 minutes. Reduce the liquid until it turns into a glaze and then strain immediately while it is still hot and then clean out the pot to reuse again for the Beef stock reduction.</p><p>BEEF:&nbsp; Trim away the excess fat from you meat of choice. Cut the meat into 2 inch cubes.&nbsp; Then in a bowl season the beef with canola oil, salt, and pepper. Sear the meat on all sides in a saut&eacute; pan. Do not over crowed the pan or you will steam them rather than brown them. Then Transfer them onto a plate with a couple layers of paper towels to absorb all the grease but leave the grease in the saut&eacute; pan.</p><p>BEEF STOCK REDUCTION: Strain the grease into the large, heavy bottom pot you used earlier for the wine reduction and bring it to high heat. When the pot is hot enough, caramelize the carrots and onions. Then add the Leakes and tomato paste and cook until the tomato paste turns brown. Add the remaining ingredients and reduce by half (Skim out the impurities, no foam on top and oil). Pre heat oven to 325 degrees. Reduced, strain the liquid and place the liquid back into the pot (Cleaned) and add the Beef. The beef should be 3/4 covered in liquid if it isn&rsquo;t then take the beef out and reduce the liquid further. Tightly cover the pot and braise the beef for about 2 hours until it is fork tender. It is important to check it every 30 minutes because it is possible that it will take a shorter or longer time to cook. Once it is done take out the beef and strain out the liquid again into the same pot. Depending on you desired consistency of the broth you can reduce it into a thicker sauce so it can coat the meat (like in the photo) and vegetables or just leave it as is.</p><p>PEARL ONIONS: In a small pot add all the ingredients. Fill it with water until it is an inch above the onions and bring it to a boil and cook it for 10 to 15 minutes until tender. Once the onions are done peal them and trim the ends. Set aside. (Do this task while the Beef stock is reducing)</p><p>BACON &amp; MUSHROOMS: Place the bacon on a sheet tray with a rack and put it in the oven at 325 degrees and rotate every 10 minutes until it is golden and crispy. Do this while the Boeuf Bourguignon is cooking in the oven. When the bacon is done strain the fat into a saut&eacute; pan and saut&eacute; the Mushroom with the rendered bacon fat, salt and pepper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PLATING: Place the meat into your dish of choice then place your vegetables neatly on top of the meat. Gently pour the hot jus on top of the meat and vegetables slowly. Then add your garnishes (Bacon, Chopped Parsley, etc).</p></div>
