<div class="editable"><p>4P Foods has teamed up with our longtime community partners at The Washington Nationals Philanthropies and its signature program, the Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, to launch a campaign to help sustain the weekly farmers market at the Academy&rsquo;s Ward 7 facility.</p><p>Since 2018, 4P Foods has partnered with the Youth Baseball Academy to supply healthy, nutrient-dense produce at an affordable, subsidized rate to community residents at their Field of Greens Market (the only year-round farmers market in Ward 7). The Youth Baseball Academy&rsquo;s Health and Wellness Programs work to address inequity and improve health outcomes through food access and education programs.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to a surge in need brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Academy distributed more than 2,000 bags of produce in 2020&mdash;increasing their distribution by 210% over the year prior. In order to keep pace with demand, the market needs to distribute up to 90 bags of produce each week. With a donation today to &ldquo;Buy A Bag&rdquo; on behalf of a neighbor in need, you can provide enough nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables for one week for a family of four.</p><h2><strong>DONATE TODAY TO FUND A BAG OF PRODUCE</strong></h2><p>There are two ways to give. 4P Foods customers can make a contribution by adding the Produce Donation Bag to an upcoming delivery or opting to donate rather than skip an future order. To make a regular contribution, choose a recurring frequency from the dropdown when you add it to your cart. Anyone can make a direct tax-deductible contribution to the weekly market through the &ldquo;Buy a Bag&rdquo; donation page on the National Philanthropies <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://give.nats4good.org/give/321025/#!/donation/checkout">website</a>.</p><h3><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shop.4pfoods.com/donate]"><strong>BUY A DONATION BAG</strong></a></h3><p><img width="975" height="650" src="uploads/2021-4pfoods-wnyba-marketbag.jpg" /></p><address><em>Images courtesy of The Washington Nationals Philanthropies.</em></address><address>&nbsp;</address><p>To learn more about Washington Nationals Philanthropy and the Youth Baseball Academy, visit their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nats4good.org/youth-baseball-academy/health-and-nutrition/">website</a>.
