<div class="editable"><p>We are pleased to announce that 4P has received an investment from the Bernard J. Tyson Impact Fund, which is administered by The American Heart Association. The Bernard J. Tyson Impact Fund invests in organizations and companies breaking down the social and economic barriers to health equity.</p><p>&ldquo;We were drawn to 4P based on how they are transforming food systems by creating fair market opportunities for small farmers, while also increasing equitable access to affordable, healthy food throughout the region,&rdquo; said Max Gritzuk, Portfolio Manager at American Heart Association&rsquo;s Social Impact Fund. &ldquo;We are excited that with this investment, 4P Foods will be able to expand their double impact model.&rdquo;</p><p>We will use the investment to develop IT infrastructure, with a focus on promoting full supply network transparency while improving inventory management systems. Funding will also be used to optimize logistics and expand regional distribution, with the goal to increase Good Food access in underserved communities.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;At 4P Foods, our mission is twofold. First, to help farmers not just to survive, but to thrive. And second, to make sure everyone &mdash; no matter their race, zip code, or income &mdash; has access to that food,&rdquo; explains Founder and CEO Tom McDougall. &ldquo;Good Food should be a right, not a privilege. Together with our partners, we&rsquo;re fighting to make that a reality.&rdquo;</p><p>We work with many organizations to help increase access to Good Food in the communities it serves. Partners include Local Food Hub and their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/16/food-medicine-covid-health-care-511169">Fresh Farmacy initiative</a>, in which 4P Foods aggregates, packs, and delivers Good Food to individuals prescribed nutrient-dense, local food for better health. We also work with the Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy to provide fresh fruits and vegetables in Ward 7 and 8 of Washington, D.C. through The Field of Greens Market. This year to date, more than 9,000 bags of fresh food have been distributed through these two programs.&nbsp;</p><p>4P Foods recently expanded its partnerships to include <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://brighterbites.org/about/">Brighter Bites</a>, a national organization that distributes fresh produce and educational materials to schools in underserved communities. The partnership launched in September of 2021 and 4P Foods will distribute fruits and vegetables to schools in Prince George&rsquo;s County, Maryland, where Brighter Bites serves more than 2,800 families.&nbsp;</p><p>Since launching in 2014, 4P Foods has connected 600 producers with 12,000 customers and 250 wholesale buyers. We will continue to grow our operations and mission by nurturing partnerships with other food hubs along the East Coast, building relationships that support local and regional farmers, and bringing fresh, high-quality produce, meat, dairy, and pantry items to its wholesale and retail customers.</p></div>
