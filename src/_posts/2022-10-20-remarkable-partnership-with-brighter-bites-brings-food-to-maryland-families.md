4P Foods aggregates, quality checks, and delivers fruits and vegetables for Brighter Bites’ box program in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Brighter Bites is a nonprofit creating&nbsp; healthier communities by increasing access to fresh food. Their mission is to change eating habits among children and their families to increase health outcomes

4P Foods&nbsp; delivers food to 18 elementary schools across Prince George’s County packed into boxes by volunteers. These fruits and vegetables feed 1,150 food insecure families. Each family receives two boxes of food every month, including&nbsp; during the summer when many families struggle due to school food programs being closed during the season.&nbsp;

“We are so grateful for our partnership \[with 4P Foods\] and the impact it allows us to create TOGETHER\!\!\! ” - Emily O., Brighter Bites Senior Program Manager

Our partnership with [Brighter Bites began in October 2021](https://4pfoods.com/posts/brighter-bites-a-new-4p-foods-partnership/). Since then, 4P Foods has sorted and quality checked more than 19,000lbs of fruits and vegetables every week.
