From impressing the in-laws to celebrating with friends, we all know just how much we need to get done to to prepare for the holidays. With 4P Foods, you can be the host with the most and show your love for the planet\!

This holiday season upgrade your holiday hosting, improve your carbon footprint, and reduce your stress with these simple ideas.

# **\#1 Buy in-season produce.**

#### *In-season, local produce tastes better than produce traveling longer distances.*

Fresh food tastes better and is more nutrient dense. In-season produce sourced from local and regional farms is harvested when fully ripe for better flavor and [better nutrients](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-benefits-of-farmers-markets){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Produce from 4P Foods travels an average of 300 miles, whereas produce in the grocery store travels an average of 1,300 miles to reach your table.

By adding a 4P Foods [produce tote](https://shop.4pfoods.com/4p-bags){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to your cart, you’re adding all that flavor to your side dishes, desserts, and appetizers. Easy Pea-sy\!

# **\#2 Get your groceries delivered.**

#### *Let us save you time while delivering products from independent farmers and artisans right to your doorstep\!*

4P Foods delivers in-season produce and pantry staples sourced from independent farmers and artisans we know and trust in Washington, DC, Virginia, Maryland, and through the Eastern Seaboard and MidAtlantic. Farmers we source beyond our region meet our sourcing standards and help us offer produce not seasonally available, especially during the winter months.

# **\#3 Purchase local and ethically-raised protein.**

#### *"This is our third year ordering a KellyBronze \[turkey for Thanksgiving\]. My mother-in-law says it is by far the best turkey she's ever had\!” -Lauren B.*

Impress your in-laws\! Or your friends, parents, siblings, significant other, or yourself\! 4P Foods only provides locally-sourced and ethically-raised turkey, beef, pork, chicken, and lamb.
