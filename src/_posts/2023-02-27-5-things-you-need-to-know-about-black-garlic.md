4P Foods is very excited to offer black garlic from [Farmer D](https://www.farmer-d.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}! This unique product is delicious and very time intensive to make.

# **\#1 Farmer D's black garlic is made from heirloom garlic.**

Farmer D's specially grown heirloom garlic goes through a process called Maillard reaction to create black garlic. This process is very time intensive and requires specific conditions. Starting the process with an heirloom garlic gives Farmer D's black garlic a unique flavor.

# **\#2 Black garlic goes through an extensive aging process.**

To create black garlic, garlic bulbs are kept at a high humidity and low temperatures (anywhere from 140-190 degrees Fahrenheit)&nbsp; for weeks to allow enzymes to break down the components that give garlic its sharp flavor. These conditions bring about the chemical reaction known as the Maillard reaction that produces a black color, sticky texture, and deep flavor profiles.

# **\#3 Black garlic tastes sweet and tangy.**

The low and slow creation process gives black garlic the texture of a date with a slightly sweet, tangy flavor like balsamic vinegar. This sweet and tangy flavor pairs well with sharp cheddar and other cheeses with more pungent flavor profiles. Try adding black garlic to your [charcuterie board](https://shop.4pfoods.com/product/the-perfect-charcuterie-board) for a unique and delicious item to spread on top of cheese and crackers.

# **\#4 Black garlic has umami.**

The aging process also brings out umami. This earthy flavor is great in salad dressings, sandwich spreads, marinades, and dipping sauces. Black garlic is also a great addition to some soups like tomato soup.

# **\#5 Black garlic has more antioxidants than raw garlic.**

Black garlic has two to three times more antioxidants than raw garlic. Antioxidants protect your cells from free radicals which play a role in causing conditions like heart disease and cancer. Black garlic is a nice little wellness boost on top of being delicious.
