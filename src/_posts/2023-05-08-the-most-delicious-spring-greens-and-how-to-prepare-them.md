It’s easy being green in the spring. Greens emerge from the soil to mark the beginning of spring and encourage us humans to refresh our diet with these low calorie sources of fiber, vitamins, calcium, and potassium.

# **Dandelion Greens**

Dandelion greens are red and green leaves that grow on the dandelion plant. Their short season is from late March to June. Dandelion greens have a slightly bitter taste and go great in salads when they are balanced with sweet flavors and salt.&nbsp;

These greens are a great way to start a meal because they help stimulate your appetite and aid in digestion. Try our delicious dandelion greens salad with other in season ingredients.&nbsp;

# **Ramps**

Ramps grow in the Appalachian mountains, and they are a part of the allium family just like garlic, leeks, chives, and scallions. The word “ramps” is colloquial to Southern Appalachia, so depending where you are from you might have heard ramps called “spring onions” or “wild leeks.” Ramps also have a similar flavor to chives and scallions.

They have a very short season. Ramps are only available from late April to June depending on weather conditions. They are also in high demand, so be sure to snap them up when you see them in the 4P Foods shop. Ramps are the perfect [addition to pasta](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/ramp-pesto-spaghetti){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [just sauteed](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/ricotta-scrambled-eggs-and-buttered-ramps-on-toast){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

**STORAGE TIP**\: Submerge in cold water and swish around to remove dirt. Pat dry and then store in an airtight container with a clean damp towel for humidity.

# **Arugula**

Arugula adds peppery, slightly tart flavor to salads, pesto, sandwiches, and even pizza! Arugula is in the mustard family and originated in the Mediterranean. It is a great source of fiber, potassium, and calcium.

**FUN FACT:** Just like cilantro and beets, some people might not like the flavor of arugula because they have the gene that makes them sensitive to the spicy flavor.

It pairs well with another spring favorite: strawberries! Try our [arugula and berry salad](https://4pfoods.com/recipes/quick-arugula-and-berry-spring-salad-side-dish-recipe/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} while the season lasts.

# **Spinach**

Spinach has a mild flavor that makes it a great green to add to smoothies. The strong texture of spinach makes it a versatile green that can be cooked or raw. With its high levels of antioxidants, spinach adds a nutritious punch to sandwiches, pasta, and salads. Add spinach anywhere you want a nutritious pop of green. You can also try our [green smoothie recipe](https://4pfoods.com/recipes/simple-spinach-and-strawberry-smoothie-breakfast-recipe/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for breakfast or a snack.

# **Broccoli**

Broccoli is a vegetable we are all pretty familiar with, but we don’t usually think of it as a leafy green. Technically, broccoli is a dense leafy green. It doesn’t have the flat leaves we usually think of, but, like most greens, it is delicious and packed with nutrients including fiber.&nbsp;

Broccoli can be eaten raw or cooked. It is a great source of vitamin K and vitamin C. Try this [roasted broccoli salad from I Heart Veggies](https://iheartvegetables.com/roasted-broccoli-salad/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
