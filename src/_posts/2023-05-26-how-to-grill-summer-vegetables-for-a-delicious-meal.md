You can grill almost any vegetable that is in your produce tote.</p><p>The high, dry heat of a grill will caramelize the sugars in the vegetables. The grill also gives vegetables a complex smoky flavor which can be a really nice change if you’re a person that feels vegetables are boring. Here are a few summer vegetables to put on the grill this year.</p><h1><strong>Summer Squash</strong></h1><p>At the height of summer, zucchini and yellow squash are abundant and cooking them the same way every time can get boring. Try something new. Try grilling your summer squash and impress your guests at your next barbeque.&nbsp;</p><p>Cut yellow squash and zucchini in half lengthwise if a manageable size. However, if the squash is large, you can cut it into rounds. Brush all sides with olive oil or melted butter and season generously with salt and pepper before putting on the grill.</p><h1><strong>Broccoli&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>Broccoli lovers, unite! Take your taste buds on a journey to flavor town with the best and most delicious ways to grill your favorite green trees. Start by cutting it into large florets for easy turning and maximum caramelization. Brush the florets with olive oil or melted butter and season with salt. Grill until the broccoli is caramelized on all sides. Remove from the grill and season with red pepper flakes.</p><h1><strong>Corn</strong></h1><p>Get ready to take your corn on the cob game to the next level. Skip the husk and aluminum foil if you want to grill, not steam, your corn. Before grilling, generously season your shucked corn with olive oil or melted butter, salt, and pepper. You will grill the corn until it is browned on all sides.</p><p>Grilling summer vegetables is a fantastic way to add some variety and flavor to your meals. Whether you're a grilling pro or a newbie, these tips and tricks will help you create delicious and healthy dishes that will impress your family and friends.
