Easter is a time for celebration and tradition, and dyeing Easter eggs is one of the most popular traditions. However, most commercial egg dyes contain chemicals that can potentially harm the environment and your health. Try this fun and egg-citing way to use natural ingredients to dye your eggs. Hereâ€™s how to dye Easter eggs using beets, turmeric, spinach, and yellow onion.

#### **Red or Pink Egg Dye**

**Ingredients**

* 1 large beet
* 4 cups of water
* 1 tbsp. white vinegar

#### **Instructions**

Peel and chop the beet into small pieces, then add them to a large saucepan with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes until the water turns a deep red color. Allow to cool, then strain the beet pieces and add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the dye.

#### **Yellow Dye**

**Ingredients**

* 2 tbsp. turmeric powder
* 4 cups of water
* 1 tbsp. white vinegar

#### **Instructions**

Combine 2 tablespoons of turmeric with 4 cups of boiling water in a separate saucepan. Let the mixture cool, and then add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the dye.

#### **Brown or Green Dye**

**Ingredients**

* 2 cups fresh spinach leaves
* 4 cups of water
* 1 tbsp. white vinegar

#### **Instructions**

Add 2 cups of fresh spinach leaves to 4 cups of boiling water. Cook for 15 minutes, and then remove the spinach leaves. Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the dye.

#### **Orange** **Dye**

**Ingredients**

* 1 large yellow onion
* 4 cups of water
* 1 tbsp. white vinegar

#### **Instructions**

Peel and chop the large yellow onion into small pieces, and then add them to 4 cups of boiling water. Boil for 20 minutes, then allow to cool. Strain the onion pieces, and then add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to the dye.

#### **How to Dye the Eggs**

Place your desired number of eggs in a large pot and add one of the natural dyes to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and allow the eggs to simmer for 10-15 minutes. The longer the eggs remain in the dye, the deeper the color will be. Remove the eggs from the pot and let them cool on a paper towel.

#### **How to Create Designs**

You can create unique designs on your eggs using a white crayon or rubber band to protect the part of the egg you do not want to dye. This will create a beautiful pattern on your Easter eggs.

**Pro Tip:** To add a shine to your eggs, rub them with a small amount of vegetable oil.
