4P Foods is delivering purpose-fueled food for the prosperity of our planet and people. Each day, our work at 4P Foods gets us closer to an equitable, regional food system. With a growing network of partners we are building a system in which: farmers are creating generational wealth; soil is regeneratively nourished; animals are treated humanely; and all communities have equal access to healthy food. We prioritize traditionally marginalized communities on both ends of the pipeline: assisting socially disadvantaged farmers and producers to access markets; and bringing food insecure communities fresh, healthy, planet-friendly and local produce, meat, dairy, and shelf stable products.

In the past 10 years, 4P Foods has built this model into a scalable enterprise. We’ve established a robust distribution network and cultivated a network of community partners to help farmers meet demand. These partnerships include co-founding and launching the Eastern Food Hub Collaborative (EFC) and Mid-Atlantic Food Resilience and Access Coalition. Other notable partnerships include the Virginia Federation of Food Banks for food access programs, Virginia Department of Education for Farm to School, more than a dozen universities and colleges, 200+ restaurant partners, and Children’s National for Food-Is-Medicine.

##### This has resulted in sales across multiple channels that put  $27M into rural economies across the Mid-Atlantic region.
