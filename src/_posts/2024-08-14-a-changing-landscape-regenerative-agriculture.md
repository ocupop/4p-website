Regenerative agriculture is a growing and changing landscape that can include different practices based on what crop or livestock the farm is raising. Imagine a farm that not only produces scrumptious and nutritious food but also works like a natural ecosystem, buzzing with life and energy. That's what regenerative farmers strive for – a balance that supports all life forms.

Regenerative farms are looking to:

1. Promote biodiversity. Mono-cultures are extremely rare in nature and are not beneficial to an ecosystem. By keeping more than one species in a pasture or by rotating crops and cover crops, growers can mimic a diverse ecosystem. Therefore, working with nature instead of against it.
2. Build soil health. With practices like high-density rotational grazing, no till practices, and experimenting with growing more native edible plants (like [Patagonia Provisions Kernza](https://shop.4pfoods.com/product/kernza-fusilli-pasta-14oz){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}), farmers are preventing erosion and helping build organic matter in the soil and giving a better foundation for the ecosystem.
3. Sequester carbon in the soil. Soil carbon sequestration is a process in which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and stored in the soil carbon pool. This process is mainly accomplished by plants during photosynthesis, which is why it is important to keep plants in the soil. Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) has been steadily declining since the industrial revolution and the increase is large scale monoculture crop and livestock production. This means more carbon is in our atmosphere.

##### "Regenerative agriculture means a shift away from a food supply that is based on degradation, exploitation, and extraction. And, none of this is new! Some of the exciting technologies associated with regenerative agriculture may be recently developed, but the foundational practices are based on ancient and Indigenous principles and wisdom. Rather than shifting yet further away from our roots, we’re shifting back as we move forward.”

# Building Soil Health in Virginia

Kinloch Farm is on over 3000 acres of protected and historic farmland in Virginia’s Piedmont. Kinloch Farm proudly operates at “the intersection of agriculture and conservation.” They believe these agriculture and conservation go hand-in-hand, and that is why they pursue regenerative management of the land.

Through their management in of their grasslands, savannas, riparian areas, and wetlands, they promote native species diversity, wildlife and pollinator habitat, health of waterways, and carbon sequestration. They quantify this work through our research partnerships with local, regional, and national organizations.

In 2023 they were verified through Savory’s Ecological Outcome Verification program giving them the data to continue to regenerate the land and build soil health. The Robinia Institue, a Savory Institute hub, located in Wingina, VA will continue to monitor Kinloch Farm’s land health.
