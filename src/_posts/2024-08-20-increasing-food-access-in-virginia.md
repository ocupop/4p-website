4P Foods increased our food access work in 2023 by partnering with the Virginia Federation of Food Banks, Local Environmental Agriculture Project (LEAP), and the Mid-Atlantic Food Resiliency and Access Coalition on two government funded programs that connected more people to nutrient-dense food grown by local and regional farmers.

In June of 2023, 4P Foods headquarters was busy packing boxes of Virginia sourced produce for the Virginia Farm to Virginia Families Box Program. This program focused on sourcing Virginia products to be packed into boxes and sent to food banks across the Commonwealth. In the colder months, it expanded to include boxes packed full of protein such as pasture raised meat and locally produced tofu.

In July 2023, 4P Foods Kicked off our participation in the Local Food Purchasing Assistance Program by delivering boxes full of local food to the Mid-Atlantic Food Resiliency and Access Coalition (MAFRAC) and Local Environmental Agricultural Project(LEAP). This program continued throughout 2023 and into 2024.
