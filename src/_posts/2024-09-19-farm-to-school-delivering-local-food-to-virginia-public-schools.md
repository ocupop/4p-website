##### "4P Foods is the bridge between us and the local Virginia Farmers. The partnership makes sense for all involved, as they can connect the growers to the schools through purchasing and delivering fresh produce and meats. The items we receive each week are picked from the fields within days of delivery so it’s guaranteed to be fresher, more nutritious – not to mention tastier. We are also helping put dollars back into the local economy,” says Bruce Davis, Prince Edward County Public Schools
