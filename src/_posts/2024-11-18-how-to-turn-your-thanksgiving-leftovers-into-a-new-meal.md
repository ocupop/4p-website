# **Roasted Pumpkin Seeds Using Hungry Hill Honey**

Save the seeds from that [pie pumpkin you roasted](https://4pfoods.com/posts/how-to-roast-a-pie-pumpkin-and-get-delicious-pumpkin-puree/)! They make a great fall snack for holiday travel, the perfect garnish for leftover soup, or a crunchy autumn addition to a salad or grain bowl.

These simple sweet and salty pumpkin seeds will serve up to five people depending on how snack-y you are feeling this autumn. Plus, you can store your honey roasted pumpkin seeds in a sealed container in your pantry for snacks during the winter months.

Mashed potatoes are a Thanksgiving staple, but before you compost the potato skins, try our air fried crispy potato skin recipe. This is a great snack for watching football or binging Netflix plus it helps you get the most out of the potatoes you purchased. It’s a no fuss and quick recipe that is perfect for someone who wants to reduce their food waste, but not put in a bunch of time. This recipe can also be used on sweet potato skins.

# **Spicy Cauliflower Using Catbird Hot Sauce**

Using a whole head of cauliflower can be daunting, so we suggest trying this plant-based substitute for hot wings. This recipe will also work if the cauliflower has already been roasted.

Spicy cauliflower is great for game day and goes well with [blue cheese dip](https://4pfoods.com/recipes/hot-wings--blue-cheese-dip/). Be sure to add [Catbird Hot Sauce](https://shop.4pfoods.com/product/catbird-sriracha-hot-sauce) to your 4P Foods tote for delivery.
