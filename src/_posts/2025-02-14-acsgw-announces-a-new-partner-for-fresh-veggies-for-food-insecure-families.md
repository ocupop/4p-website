“We are honored to partner with ACSGW to help bridge the food insecurity gap and nourish families in the community. Through our collaboration with John and his team, we’ve created a program that connects local growers—and their seasonal produce—with households in need. It’s a win-win for farmers and families alike!” -Devon Byrne, 4P Foods Food Is Medicine Account Manager

Adventist Community Services of Greater Washington announces a new partnership with 4P Foods to provide food insecure families in the Takoma Park East Silver Spring community. 4P Foods sources fresh, high-quality food providing local and regional farmers new markets and equitable access to food.  Through the 4P Foods partnership ACSGW can provide a fresh veggie box to every food program participant.  This initiative builds on 4P Food’s “food as medicine” program.

A Food Insecurity Grant from the City of Takoma Park and a Montgomery County Community Food Assistance grant provided the funding support needed to provide ACSGW food participants with substantially more nutritional food.

Special thanks to the Montgomery County Food Council and the Capital Area Community Food Bank for their continued assistance in identifying sources of fresh, high quality food.

John Gavin, ACSGW Executive Director
