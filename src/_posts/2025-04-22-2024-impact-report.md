In 2024, our 10th year in business, 4P Foods continued the march toward a more equitable, regenerative, and resilient food system. We are committed to promoting soil health, biodiversity, and climate resilience through agricultural practices that work in partnership with Mother Earth. Guided by our mission to connect regional farmers with consumers and institutions through values-driven supply chains, we expanded our impact across the Mid-Atlantic region—deepening relationships, increasing access to nutritious food, and supporting regenerative agriculture.

This year, 4P Foods facilitated the distribution of more than $12M worth of locally and sustainably grown food to households, schools, and organizations. We onboarded 30 new small- and mid-sized producers, with a continued focus on working with historically marginalized producers. Our network now includes more than 200 farms, all committed to ecological stewardship and fair labor practices. We strengthened our food access initiatives through partnerships with community organizations, and continued the expansion of our Food-is-Medicine programming. Through our efforts, we helped bridge the food equity gap for tens of thousands of food-insecure households.

4P Foods' work is rooted in the belief that food can be a force for good. In 2024, that belief translated into real-world outcomes: Healthier communities, stronger local economies, and meaningful progress toward a regenerative food future. As we look ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to People, Planet, Prosperity, and Purpose—the four P’s that define our path forward. Thank you for being such an important part of it.
