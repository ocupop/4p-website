  Since 2020, we've partnered with Fauquier Free Clinic and PATH Foundation to
  bring this belief to life through a produce prescription program—a nutrition
  solution that delivers fresh, local produce directly to food insecure patients
  managing chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. This program
  serves the community at both ends of the pipeline: getting fresh food to those
  who need it and providing a market for local farmers to sell the nutritious
  food they are growing.
