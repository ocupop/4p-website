  Since 2020, we've partnered with Fauquier Free Clinic and PATH Foundation to
  bring this belief to life through a produce prescription program—a nutrition
  solution that delivers fresh, local produce directly to food insecure patients
  managing chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. This program
  serves the community at both ends of the pipeline: getting fresh food to those
  who need it and providing a market for local farmers to sell the nutritious
  food they are growing.

At 4P Foods, we believe that food is medicine. Since 2020, we've partnered with Fauquier Free Clinic and PATH Foundation to bring this belief to life through a produce prescription program—a nutrition solution that delivers fresh, local produce directly to food insecure patients managing chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. This program serves the community at both ends of the pipeline: getting fresh food to those who need it and providing a market for local farmers to sell the nutritious food they are growing.

An extension of the clinic’s diabetes and diet teaching program, the produce prescription program has evolved into an important part of holistic care for patients at the clinic. By providing patients with farm-fresh fruits, vegetables, and eggs, the program supports healthier eating habits and empowers individuals to take control of their health.

As Clinic Director Rob Marino reflects:

“The produce prescription program is a creative solution that allows us to bring healthy food choices to our patients while also supporting our local farmers. It's great to hear from patients when they tell us how much they like the food and what kinds of new cooking they are experimenting with at home. I have been really pleased with the program since we started back in 2020.”

**2024 Impact: Nourishing Lives**

In 2024, the Fauquier Free Clinic served 2,242 unique patients across 12,252 free care visits. Among these, 2,301 visits were dedicated to diabetes and diet education, highlighting the clinic's commitment to integrating nutrition into patient care. The produce prescription serves a portion of food insecure patients in the diabetes and diet education program.

Matthew, a patient at the Fauquier Free Clinic suffering from neuropathy, high blood pressure, and other ailments, experienced significant health improvements through the clinic's care. A key component of his treatment was enrollment in the Produce Prescription Program. The regularity and reliability of home-delivered fresh produce and eggs from 4P Foods has enhanced Matthew's nutrition and improved his overall health.

**Why source local?**

While the avian flu has led to egg shortages and price increases nationwide, some small to medium size farms in the Mid-Atlantic have managed to maintain stable supplies of free-range eggs. Eggs for this prescription program are sourced from Edgewood Farms, Alderfer Farms, and Virginia Fresh Farms.

Edgewood Farms, located in Greene County, Virginia, is renowned for its commitment to sustainable and humane farming practices. Their hens are raised in mobile shelters, rotated regularly on fresh pastures, and fed non-GMO grain. This approach ensures that the chickens have ample space to roam and forage, leading to high-quality, nutritious eggs.

Virginia Fresh Farms is a collective of family-owned farms across Virginia, dedicated to sustainable agriculture and providing fresh, local produce to the community. These farms prioritize natural feeding practices and humane animal treatment.

Alderfer Farms, based in Southeastern Pennsylvania, is a fifth-generation family farm specializing in organic and free range eggs. Their hens are fed a 100% vegetarian, organic diet without pesticides, herbicides, or GMOs. The farm is Certified Organic by Pennsylvania Certified Organic and the USDA National Organic Program.

These farms exemplify diverse approaches to ethical and sustainable egg production; providing a stable supply of nutritious local food.

**A Model for Community Health**

Fauquier Free Clinic’s Produce Prescription Program exemplifies how community partnerships can create sustainable health solutions. By connecting patients with local farmers, the program supports the local economy while also addressing food insecurity and chronic health issues.

At 4P Foods, we're proud to source, pack, and deliver Food-is-Medicine interventions that align with our mission to build a more equitable and regenerative food system. Together with Fauquier Free Clinic, we're demonstrating that access to healthy food is not a privilege but a right—and a powerful prescription for a healthier future.
