At 4P Foods, we believe that everyone deserves access to food that’s fresh, nutritious, and grown with care. That belief comes to life with a partnership between 4P Foods, Encompass Community Supports, and the PATH Foundation to deliver fresh produce and eggs to Encompass Community Supports senior centers in Fauquier and Rappahannock counties. Together, we delivered more than just groceries to local seniors—we delivered dignity, wellness, and joy.

**The Prescription for a Healthier Community**

Farm-fresh produce and eggs are sourced from local farms and packed into bags at 4P Food headquarters. 4P Foods bags were then delivered directly into the hands of 76 senior community members across Fauquier and Rappahannock counties. Over the course of the year, participants received 836 thoughtfully packed bags—each one brimming with seasonal fruits, vegetables, and farm-fresh eggs.

Funded through a $30K grant from the PATH Foundation, this produce prescription program addressed food insecurity head-on while promoting a regenerative and equitable food system.

These weren’t just groceries—they were opportunities. Opportunities to cook familiar recipes like mom used to make. To try kale or squash for the very first time. To nourish bodies affected by chronic illness.

As one participant shared, “It added to my daily intake of fruit and veggies. The eggs were a huge benefit.”

Another said, “They offer a variety of fruit and veggies that I have never eaten before.”

Food security isn’t just about filling plates—it’s about filling lives with health and wholesome connection. Produce prescription programs do just that, by bridging the gap between family farms and local seniors, many of whom face barriers to accessing fresh foods.

From beets to berries, every item in those 836 bags was a piece of a bigger picture—rebuilding a food system that works for the people growing the food and the people receiving it.

We’re incredibly grateful to Encompass Community Supports and our partners for continuing to make this impact possible. At 4P Foods, we fight for a food system rooted in equity, community, and care—for farmers and makers and the communities they serve.

Because good food is not a privilege. It’s a prescription for a better future.
