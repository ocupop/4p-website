At 4P Foods, we believe in building a food system that works for people, planet, and producers. That vision comes to life through partnerships like the one with Wake Forest University and Harvest Table Culinary Group, where sourcing choices go far beyond convenience to create meaningful change. Wake Forest is committed to sourcing at least 30% of ingredients that meet rigorous third-party certifications such as Certified Humane, Organic, and Fair Trade. By partnering with South Mountain Creamery and Alderfer Farms, the university now sources certified humane, in-shell eggs directly from regional producers. This strengthens supply chains that prioritize animal welfare, transparency, and climate resilience. This commitment required innovation in the kitchen. Cracking 39,600 eggs each week by hand was labor-intensive and often pushed institutions to rely on liquid eggs shipped in plastic packaging from far away. Wake Forest chose a different path. Instead of compromising on sourcing, they invested in the tools needed to make their sustainability goals possible. The Ovo-Tech UDTJ-10, a semi-automatic egg-cracking machine, is part of that solution. What might appear to be a small kitchen upgrade is actually a major step forward. By automating the cracking process, staff gain back hundreds of hours each week to focus on quality and hospitality while the dining program continues to prioritize local, ethical sourcing. “By partnering with South Mountain Creamery and Alderfer Farms, we are committed to purchasing certified humane eggs for use in our dining halls at Wake Forest University,” said Jonathan Burns, Harvest Table Culinary Group Director of Culinary Development. “This change will increase our third-party verified spend and help further our sustainable efforts on campus. This new machine will significantly reduce the plastic involved with liquid egg product and the need for manual egg cracking of approximately 39,600 eggs weekly across campus and which will free up our people to focus that time on the guest experience." This shift reflects what we at 4P Foods champion every day: a food system where institutions intentionally choose sourcing from small and mid-sized producers and back up those commitments with the innovation needed to make them stick.

Meet the Farmers

Alderfer Farms (Southeastern PA) is a fifth-generation family farm specializing in organic and free-range eggs. Their hens are fed an organic diet without pesticides, herbicides, or GMOs. The farm is Certified Organic by Pennsylvania Certified Organic and the USDA National Organic Program.

South Mountain Creamery (Middletown, MD) is a third-generation family-owned and operated farm. Their hens are Certified Humane, cage-free, and raised to roam and dust-bathe naturally. Eggs are gathered by hand, packed on-site, and delivered fresh as part of their commitment to full transparency and keeping every part of the process close to home.
