  Warrenton-based 4P Foods received $300,000 from the American Heart Association
  recently, and 4P founder and CEO Tom McDougall said he is eager to use the
  funds to grow the “food hub.” “We are going through a transition, from a
  start-up to a real company building an equitable food system,” he said.
  McDougall said the grant will allow him to upgrade 4P’s technology. “Right
  now, it takes 17 messages with a farmer to create a transaction and involves a
  lot of human time,” he said. He also hopes to be able to accept food stamps
  through an online marketplace.
