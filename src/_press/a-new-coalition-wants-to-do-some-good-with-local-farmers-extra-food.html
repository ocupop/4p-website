  Like plenty of other business owners, Tom McDougall, the founder of food
  distributor 4P Foods based in Warrenton, Va., says things started to look bad
  for his company in March. That’s when restaurants and schools all closed to
  comply with social distancing guidelines to stop the spread of the
  coronavirus. “Our farmers…had orders being turned around” at the loading dock
  at the University of Virginia, normally 4P’s largest wholesale customer,
  McDougall says.
