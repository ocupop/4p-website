  Our food system today is a textbook paradox. We see thousands of gallons of
  milk dumped away, tons of produce left to rot and millions of animals
  euthanized. Yet miles-long lines form at food banks and grocery stores have
  spotty inventory. Consumers have been rightfully outraged at the food waste
  and flummoxed by the incongruities. How can these two realities be so
  incompatible, yet exist side by side?
