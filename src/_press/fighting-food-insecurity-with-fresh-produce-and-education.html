  Food insecurity is rising in Washington, D.C. and it’s hitting families with
  children the hardest. Not only is food insecurity a harmful chronic stressor,
  it is also a prevalent social driver that elevates the risk of numerous
  physical and mental health conditions. That’s why Children’s National Hospital
  created the Family Lifestyle Program (FLiP) – a multi-layered intervention,
  which offers Patient Navigation (FLiP-PN) and a Produce Prescription
  Intervention (FLiPRx). FLiP is a Food Is Medicine, clinical-community
  initiative that helps families get access to fresh food, build healthy habits
  and lower their risk of diet-related diseases like diabetes and obesity.
