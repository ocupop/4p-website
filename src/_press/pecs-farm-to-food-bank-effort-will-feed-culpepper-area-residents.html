  Culpeper people will soon benefit from the generosity of a Fauquier County
  farmer amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Karen Way, the owner of Ovoka Farm in
  Paris, is giving 10,000 pounds of farm-raised ground beef and pork to the
  Piedmont Environmental Council‘s Farm to Food Bank initiative, which is
  supporting food banks throughout the northern Piedmont.
