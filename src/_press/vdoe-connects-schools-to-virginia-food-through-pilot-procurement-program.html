  The Virginia Department of Education is partnering with regional food hubs to
  deliver nearly $2.2 million worth of locally produced and grown food products
  to school nutrition programs in the commonwealth. The Centralized Local
  Procurement Pilot Program — funded by a U.S. Department of Agriculture Supply
  Chain Assistance grant — is designed to help school nutrition programs avoid
  supply chain disruptions and strengthen regional food systems.
