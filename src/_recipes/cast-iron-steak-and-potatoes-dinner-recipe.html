author: 4P Foods Team Member
description_html: >-
  <p>This is the recipe for when it&rsquo;s date night or guests are coming over
  and the steaks are high. We have set up this recipe to serve two, but it can
  be scaled up if you have extra cast iron skillets. Steak and potatoes are
  delicious and filling which makes them perfect for a hearty winter dinner, but
  these ingredients are available year round. Grass-fed, grass-finished beef
  makes this recipe *chef&rsquo;s kiss.* You can shop regeneratively-raised and
  pasture-raised beef on <a

  year round!</p>
