directions_html: >-
  <p>Toast your pickling spices by putting the allspice berries, mustard seeds,
  coriander seeds, red pepper flakes, peppercorns, cloves, and cardamom pods in
  a pan on medium heat until they are fragrant. Be careful not to burn the
  spices. Watch them carefully because they will burn quickly.</p><p>Crush the
  toasted spices with a mortar and pestle (or you can use the back of a spoon).
  Stir the crumbled bay leaves and ground ginger into the crushed
  spices.</p><p>Combine 3 tbsp. of the toasted spices mixture, the gallon of
  water, half stick of cinnamon, kosher salt, and brown sugar in a pot over high
  heat. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring. Remove the brine from heat
  to cool to room temperature. Once it is at room temperature, refrigerate the
  brine to allow it to chill for a few hours.</p><p>Once the brine has chilled,
  place your beef brisket in a deep pan and completely submerge it in the brine.
  If it floats, weigh it down with a plate. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and
  allow the beef brisket to brine for 6 days. Flip the brisket once a day to
  make sure the brine is even.</p><p>After curing the brisket for 6 days, place
  the corned beef in a large pot and add enough water to cover the corned beef.
  If you want a less salty meat, add more water. Add the remaining pickling
  spices to the pot as well, and then bring to a boil.</p><p>Lower the pot to a
  simmer for 3-4 hours, until the meat is fork tender.</p><p><strong>Pro
  Tip:</strong> When serving, cut the brisket across the grain of the meat. You
  will be able to see lines in the meat. This is the “grain”. Cut perpendicular
  to those lines.</p>
