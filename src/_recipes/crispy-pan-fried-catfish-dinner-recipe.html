  <p>This recipe is a catch. Wild caught catfish is both sustainable and
  delicious. Pan-fried catfish takes quite a few steps to make, but is
  definitely worth the effort. This recipe is great all year round, but is
  perfect for a summer dinner dish. The measurements below serve two to three
  people.</p>

  <p>In a bowl, combine buttermilk, water, salt, and pepper for the
  marinade.</p><p>Cut the catfish into strips and place the strips into the bowl
  with the marinade. Set aside in the fridge while the oil heats up.</p><p>In a
  deep frying pan, pour your oil until the pan is half way full. Start heating
  the oil on low and slowly increase the heat until you reach 365 degrees
  Fahrenheit.</p><p>In a shallow pan, whisk together the cornmeal, all purpose
  flour, and Old Bay Seasoning to create the dry dredge.</p><p>Once the oil has
  reached the desired temperature, move the catfish strips from the marinade to
  the dry dredge. Evenly coat the strips in the dry ingredients. Then, using
  tongs, place the strips into the oil.</p><p>PRO TIP: Don’t put too many
  catfish strips in the oil at once. They will cause the temp of the oil to drop
  and that means the strips will not brown evenly.</p><p>Set up a plate with a
  paper towel for draining once the catfish has cooked.</p><p>Cook each strip
  for about 3 minutes or until golden brown. Flip half way through cooking.
  Remove the catfish from the oil and place on the paper towel lined plate. Salt
  to taste or season with more Old Bay Seasoning if that is your preference.</p>
