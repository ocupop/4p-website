  <p>To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
  pasta and cook until it is tender but still firm to the bite, stirring
  occasionally. Drain the pasta and toss with a little olive oil. Cover and set
  aside until ready to use.</p><p>Peel the black garlic and roughly chop it,
  keeping the pieces relatively large.</p><p>Heat a medium-to-large sauté pan
  over medium heat. Add olive oil and onions, and cook until soft and beginning
  to brown, about 4 minutes. Add black garlic and toss it with the onions. Then
  add wine, turn up the heat, and let it reduce by about ⅓. Add butter, red
  pepper flakes, swirl the pan around until it's melted into the wine and season
  generously with parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.</p><p>Add the cooked pasta
  to the pan with the sauce, and very gently toss everything together. (If
  necessary, pour everything into a large bowl to mix it.)</p><p>Season to taste
  again if necessary, sprinkle with the parmesan cheese (if desired), and
  serve.</p>
