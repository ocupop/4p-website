  <p>If you’re a little chili, this fast and easy fall weeknight recipe will
  warm you right up! Kinloch Farm’s locally made ground beef chili is perfectly
  seasoned and made from Kinloch Farm's own certified grass fed beef that is
  raised using regenerative practices. This chili is delivered frozen, so all
  you have to do is heat it up and you have four servings of delicious chili for
  dinner. To level this recipe up and add more nutrients, we suggest roasting a
  winter squash bowl. This is a simple way to make this meal more filling.</p>

  <p>Start by roasting your squash. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Depending on the size of the squash cut in half or into quarters. Scoop out
  the seeds. Brush the flesh with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and
  cinnamon. Place the squash flesh side up on a baking sheet and roast in the
  oven for 40 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>PRO TIP: Roasting squash does take a while.
  You could meal prep by roasting the squash when you have more time and storing
  in an airtight container in the refrigerator to heat up during the
  week.</p><p>Next, place your chili con carne in a pot on the stove over low to
  medium heat. You can thaw the chili con carne in the refrigerator first or
  heat up directly from frozen. Either way you choose, be sure to slowly heat
  the chili con carne up to keep it from burning. Stir occasionally to make sure
  it heats evenly.</p><p>Place your roasted squash bowl on a plate or in a bowl.
  Spoon the chili con carne into the squash bowl. Enjoy!</p>
