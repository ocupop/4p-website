directions_html: >-
  <p>Seed and half the jalape&ntilde;os. Wear food-grade gloves to avoid burning
  your hands while removing the jalape&ntilde;o seeds. Slice the jalape&ntilde;o
  in half lengthwise with a paring knife, then use the knife to cut away the
  seeds and ribs.</p><p>Make the filling by mixing softened cream cheese,
  Cheddar cheese, and bacon bits. Spoon the mixture into jalape&ntilde;o halves.
  Dip the jalape&ntilde;os in milk, then dip them in flour. Let them dry for
  about 10 minutes, then dip them in milk again. Roll the wet jalape&ntilde;os
  in breadcrumbs until they're well-coated. Let them dry, then repeat the
  milk-crumb process once more. Allow the peppers to dry completely.</p><p>Heat
  oil to 365 degrees fahrenheit in a skillet. Working in batches, fry the
  jalape&ntilde;o poppers for about 2-3 minutes until they're golden brown.
  Drain on paper towels.</p>
