  your chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

  <p>If you are baking your chicken breast, preheat your oven to 450 degrees
  Fahrenheit. If you are grilling, set your grill to medium heat.</p><p>Pat dry
  the chicken breast and brush with the olive oil on all sides. Season with all
  of the spices. Place in a baking dish and bake in the oven for about 18
  minutes or place on the grill for 18 minutes and flip it half way through. To
  ensure your chicken is cooked, use a cooking thermometer to check it has
  reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Feel free to
  marinate the chicken in the refrigerator overnight if you prefer.</p><p>Once
  cooked through, let your chicken rest outside of the oven or off the grill
  while you prepare the sandwich.</p><p>Toast your bread to desired crispiness.
  Spread 1 tbsp. of mayonnaise and 1 tsp. of mustard on one slice of the bread.
  Layer on a lettuce leaf and a tomato slice. Then, add an optional layer of one
  slice of bacon or ¼ of an avocado.</p><p>Slice your chicken and place half of
  the chicken slices on the other sandwich layers. Then, add a slice&nbsp; of
  bread on top of that.</p><p>Repeat the layering process for the second
  sandwich. Enjoy!</p>
