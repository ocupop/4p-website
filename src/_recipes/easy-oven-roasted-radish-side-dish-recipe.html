author: 4P Foods Team Member

  <p>It’s rad roasting radishes. Roasting a radish reduces the peppery flavor
  and concentrates the natural sugars making them a slightly sweet side dish for
  any meal. For this easy vegetarian recipe, you will need a sheet pan and oven.
  Radishes are available fresh in the spring and the fall, so this recipe is
  great for barbeques, picnics, and weeknight dinners. The measurements below
  serve 4 people, but can easily be scaled up for larger gatherings.</p>
