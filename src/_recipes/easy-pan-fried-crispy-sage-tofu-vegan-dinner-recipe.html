  <p>In a medium size bowl, lightly whisk together your vinegar and non-dairy
  milk. Open your tofu over the sink to drain the remaining liquid. Sliced tofu
  into rectangles (you could also do cubes if this is going to be an appetizer).
  Place the tofu in the mixture of non-dairy milk and vinegar.</p><p>As your
  tofu marinades, fill a frying pan with oil. How much oil you use depends on
  how big your pan is and how thick you cut your tofu rectangles, but a good
  rule of thumb is â…“ the height of the food. Put this on medium heat. You do not
  want to heat up your oil too fast or let it get too hot while
  cooking.</p><p>In a square or rectangular baking pan, mix together your sage,
  all purpose flour, and cornmeal. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p><p>Set up
  your dredging station by placing the marinating tofu next to the baking pan
  with your dry mixture. Your dredging station should be right next to the
  frying pan. Then, on the other side of the frying pan, set up a plate with a
  towel to rest the tofu on after frying.&nbsp;</p><p>Your oil should be hot
  enough by now. Take each piece of tofu out of the wet mixture and evenly cover
  with the dry mixture. Place one piece of tofu in the oil. If it immediately
  starts bubbling, it is hot enough and you can add in more tofu pieces. Flip
  your tofu once it is crispy on one side. Once it is crispy on all sides, move
  it to the plate with the towel.</p><p>Let cool and season with salt to
  taste.</p>
