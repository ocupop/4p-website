directions_html: >-
  <p>Deep clean all of your utensils, all the surfaces you will be using, and
  wash your hands. It&rsquo;s important to start out with clean utensils, so the
  good bacteria have the best opportunity to do their job.&nbsp;</p><p>Peel the
  wilted leaves off the outside of the cabbage. Cut the remaining cabbage into
  fourths and then cut the quartered cabbage into strips.</p><p>Put the strips
  of cabbage into a large mixing bowl and sprinkle salt on top. Massage the
  cabbage for 10 minutes to integrate the salt. The cabbage will start to become
  limp and watery.</p><p>Transfer the cabbage and the liquid in the mixing bowl
  into the clean mason jar. Tamp the cabbage down as you go, so it will be
  tightly packed. Once all of the cabbage strips and liquid are transferred to
  the jar, place one of the outer leaves removed from the cabbage on top to keep
  the cabbage submerged under the liquid.&nbsp;</p><p>Cover the top of the mason
  jar with cheesecloth or clean tea towel and secure it with the outer ring of
  the mason jar top. This will let the contents breath without letting dust in
  the jar.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next day, press down on the cabbage every few
  hours to keep the cabbage submerged in the liquid. Let the sauerkraut ferment
  in a cool, dark place for three to ten days.</p><p>Replace the cloth with the
  full mason jar lid and keep in the refrigerator for up to two months.</p>
