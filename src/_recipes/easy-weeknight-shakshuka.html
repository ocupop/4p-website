  <ol><li>Heat olive oil in a skillet pan over medium heat. Add diced onions,
  chopped garlic, and red pepper flakes and saute until onions start to turn
  translucent. Add a pinch of salt and ground black pepper to
  taste.&nbsp;</li><li>Add the diced fresh tomatoes into the pan, stir and
  season with more salt. Add water to thin out tomatoes if needed. After a few
  minutes, add the regeneratively-grown chickpeas and chopped kale,
  stir.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the tomato base starts to bubble (5-10 minutes) use a
  spoon to create four egg-sized &ldquo;craters&rdquo; in the sauce - this is
  where your farm fresh eggs will go!&nbsp;</li><li>Carefully crack one egg into
  each tomato crater, season them with salt and pepper, and cover the pan to
  allow the eggs to cook.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the eggs have reached your
  preferred doneness, spoon an egg and tomato mixture into a bowl over cooked
  rice or add a toasted pita for scooping and dunking</li><li>If preferred,
  finish your bowl with feta, grated parmesan, or a spoonful of plain yogurt and
  a drizzle of olive oil.</li></ol>
