title: Easy Weeknight Shakshuka
author:
description_html: >-
  <p>This is a very loose version of shakshuka, a Middle Eastern dish that has
  its roots in Tunisia but can be found in varying forms throughout North
  Africa, Egypt, Palestine, and Israel. I like using a couple of my pantry
  staples like white beans and canned crushed tomatoes to help me clean out my
  shelves, but you can completely omit the beans, switch it up with chickpeas,
  or use fresh tomatoes to make the base for the sauce. I like to use kale,
  onions, and fresh eggs from my 4P bags in this recipe, but you can mix it up
  and add bell peppers, fresh spinach, sliced zucchini or any number of
  vegetables you have on hand from your weekly 4P shares here.</p>
ingredients_html: >-
  <ul><li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li><li>Half teaspoon crushed red pepper
  flakes</li><li>Salt and pepper to taste</li><li>1 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes
  (I like San Marzano, but any will be great here!)</li><li>1 15 oz. can beans,
  rinsed - I used Navy beans for this version</li><li>1 white or yellow onion,
  sliced</li><li>2 cloves garlic, diced</li><li>Half a bunch of kale (curly,
  lacinato, red russian all work), roughly chopped&nbsp;</li><li>4
  eggs</li><li>Pita bread or rice for serving!</li><li>Feta cheese, grated
  parmesan, or plain greek yogurt for serving (optional)</li></ul>
directions_html: >-
  <ol><li>Heat olive oil in a skillet pan over medium heat. Add sliced onions,
  chopped garlic, and red pepper flakes and sautee until onions start to turn
  translucent. I like to add a pinch of salt and ground black pepper at this
  stage.&nbsp;</li><li>Pour the crushed tomatoes into the pan, stir and season
  with more salt. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll add some water and Better Than Bouillon
  base to thin out the tomatoes. After a few minutes add the rinsed beans and
  chopped kale, stir.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the tomato base starts to bubble (5-10
  minutes) use a spoon to create four egg-sized &ldquo;craters&rdquo; in the
  sauce - this is where your eggs will go!&nbsp;</li><li>Carefully crack one egg
  into each tomato crater, season them with salt and pepper, and cover the pan
  to allow the eggs to cook.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the eggs have reached your
  preferred doneness, spoon an egg and tomato mixture into a bowl over cooked
  rice or add a toasted pita for scooping and dunking</li><li>If using, finish
  your bowl with feta, grated parmesan, or a spoonful of plain yogurt and a
  drizzle of olive oil.</li></ol>
