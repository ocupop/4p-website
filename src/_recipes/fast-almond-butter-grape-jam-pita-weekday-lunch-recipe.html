  <p>Nostalgia on a plate? Thatâ€™s our jam. This fast and easy recipe will take
  five minutes and is perfect for lunch, a quick weeknight dinner, or just a
  snack. Heirloom almond butter for Big Spoon Roasters and locally grown grape
  jam elevate this take on a PB&amp;J. This makes a single serving and is great
  all year round, but is especially good for school lunches.</p>
ingredients_html: >-
  <ul><li>2 tbsp. almond butter</li><li>1 tbsp. concord grape jam</li><li>1
  Greek style pita</li></ul>
directions_html: >-
  <p>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Warm your pita in the oven for
  3-4 minutes or until it has reached your desired temperature.</p><p>Using a
  butter knife spread the almond butter on top of the pita in an even layer.
  Then, on top of the almond butter, place three small dollops of concord grape
  jam. Use the tip of the butter knife to swirl the jam into the almond butter.
  Enjoy!</p>
