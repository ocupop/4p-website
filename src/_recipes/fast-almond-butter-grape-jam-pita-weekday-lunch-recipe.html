  <p>Nostalgia on a plate? That’s our jam. This fast and easy recipe will take
  five minutes and is perfect for lunch, a quick weeknight dinner, or just a
  snack. Heirloom almond butter for Big Spoon Roasters and locally grown jam
  elevate this take on a PB&amp;J. This makes a single serving and is great all
  year round, but is especially good for school lunches.</p>
