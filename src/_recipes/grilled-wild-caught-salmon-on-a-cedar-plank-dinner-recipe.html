  <p>We’re fishing for compliments with this grilled wild-caught salmon on a
  cedar plank dinner recipe. This is great for summer barbeques or just a nice
  weeknight dinner. We have salmon already on a cedar plank ready to go on the
  grill, which makes this recipe a little bit easier. The measurements below
  will serve four people.</p>
