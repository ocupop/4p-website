title: Simple Air Fryer Hot Wings with Blue Cheese Dip Appetizer Recipe
author: 4P Foods Team Member
description_html: >-
  <p>Nothing says party, tailgate, football season quite like hot wings and blue
  cheese dip. Don&rsquo;t wing it with some other hot wing recipe; use our
  organic chicken party wings and locally-sourced blue cheese to create a
  delicious shareable appetizer. This recipe makes six to eight servings, but
  can easily be scaled up to serve more friends. The wings can be made on a
  grill if that is available to you, but this air fryer recipe is great for
  apartment made hot wings.&nbsp;</p>
