  <p>These wings are for sharing with friends! Julianne cooks the wings in an
  air-fryer on the grill pan, but the wings could also be done on a grill. The
  blue cheese dip is her dad's recipe. "The blue cheese dip says 'black pepper
  to taste', because my dad adds A LOT of black pepper. Like too much," Julianne
  explained.&nbsp;</p>
