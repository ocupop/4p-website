  <p>Pie there! This spin on a traditional Italian Easter spinach pie is a
  showstopper at brunch gatherings. Slicing into the pie and seeing the
  decorative cooked egg in the center of the slice will wow your friends and
  family. We are so grateful to 4P Foodie Tara Hoot for sharing this vegetarian
  recipe with us. It truly is cheesy and delicious and perfect for spring. The
  pie can be sliced into eight pieces. Watch Tara Hoot&rsquo;s <a

  <p>To make the dough, stir together flour and salt in a large bowl or food
  processor. Add the butter pieces into the spinning food processor until
  incorporated. You can also add butter pieces by hand, rubbing together using
  your fingers until evenly incorporated. Once butter is incorporated, the
  mixture resembles cornmeal. If using a food processor, transfer to a bowl and
  continue.</p><p>Beat 3 eggs in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center of
  flour mixture. Add beaten eggs into the flour well and stir with a fork to
  combine.&nbsp;</p><p>Stir in 3 tablespoons of ice water. Continue adding up to
  2 tablespoons of ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until a shaggy dough
  forms. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours
  or up to 3 days.</p><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees
  fahrenheit.</p><p>Unwrap chilled dough; Split the dough into ⅔ and ⅓ if using
  springform or into 1/4s for two &lsquo;normal&rsquo; sized pies. Place on a
  lightly floured work surface, and roll to &frac14; inch thickness. The larger
  one will be the bottom piece. This is enough dough for a bottom and top layer
  in a 9 inch springform pan, or probably enough dough for 2 pies, bottom and
  top, in a regular sized pie pan.</p><p>To make the filling, saute diced onion
  and garlic over medium heat in a bit of olive oil until translucent and soft.
  Set aside.</p><p>In a large bowl, mix ricotta, chopped spinach, shredded
  cheese and sauteed onion and garlic. Add salt and pepper or other preferred
  spices. Then, thoroughly mix in 2 eggs.</p><p>Put the bottom layer of pie
  crust into your chosen pie pan. Spoon mixture into pie shell. Scoop out 4
  indentations (enough for a raw egg to be cracked into it) and then, you
  guessed it, crack an egg into each indentation. If you&rsquo;re a stickler for
  perfectly round eggs, you can hard boil the 4 eggs before and place them in
  the pie.</p><p>Cover pie with other pie crust. Crimp edges.&nbsp;</p><p>Tara
  Hoot&rsquo;s hot tip: Whatever pie pan you are using, both bottom and top
  crusts should extend beyond the pie plate so you have enough dough to crimp
  and seal the pie. If using a springform pan, I find that when I crimp, I crimp
  it towards the middle of the pie so that the crust doesn&rsquo;t hang over the
  outside of the springform. If the pie dough hangs over, the crust may break
  off when you release the spring form.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re baking a
  springform pie, plan on at least 90 minutes. If using a regular pie pan, plan
  on about 45 minutes of baking.</p><p>Slice and enjoy!</p>
