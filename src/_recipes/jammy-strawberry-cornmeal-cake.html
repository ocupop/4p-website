title: Jammy Strawberry Cornmeal Cake
author: 'Amanda Mac de Villiers, Grower Support Specialist at 4P Foods'

  <p>This sweet little cake celebrates strawberries and the start of summer.
  Using cornmeal in baking is a great Southern tradition and also adds toothsome
  texture! I like to use fruits and honey in my baking because I try to
  experiment with different ways to satisfy my sweet tooth while using less
  refined sugar.</p>

directions_html: >-
  <p>Preheat oven to 350 F.</p><p>Grease &amp; line a large round cake pan or
  liberally grease a 10&rdquo; or 12&rdquo; cast iron pan.</p><p><strong>Cake:
  </strong>Whisk together dry ingredients. Combine melted butter, brown sugar,
  honey &amp; buttermilk; beat till well mixed. Add lemon zest &amp; vanilla.
  Beat in eggs one at a time.</p><p>Add half the dry ingredients and mix, then
  add in the second half and mix again.</p><p>Stir jam until it is a runny
  consistency (warm very lightly if needed to achieve runny
  consistency).</p><p>Pour batter into pan. Dollop jam in spots over the batter.
  Gently swirl the jam into the batter.</p><p>Press strawberry halves into the
  batter. I like to leave the strawberries uncovered by batter and alternate
  some cut side up and some cut side down.</p><p>Sprinkle all over with the 2
  Tbsp raw turbinado sugar. Bake approximately 30 mins until
  golden.</p><p><strong>Whip Cream: </strong>While the cake bakes, prepare fresh
  whipped cream: beat together 1 cup heavy cream, 1-2 Tbsp powdered sugar and 1
  tsp vanilla extract for a few minutes, until stiff peaks form.</p><p>Let cake
  cool, then slice and served with whipped cream.</p>
