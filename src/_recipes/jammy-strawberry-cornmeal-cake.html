author: 4P Foods Team Member Amanda Mac de Villiers

  <p>The delicious combination of strawberries, honey and cornmeal creates a
  cake that is perfect for celebrating the season! Made without refined sugar,
  it's a strawesome gluten-free, low-carb option for summer
  dessert.&nbsp;</p><p>This easy 30-minute strawberry cornmeal cake is a great
  example of classic Southern cooking. Cornmeal has been used in baking for
  centuries, and it adds a delightful chewiness to the cake. The strawberries
  are tucked into the batter, so they cook deliciously soft in the oven but
  their flavor concentrates as they bake. It will definitely cake your
  day!&nbsp;</p>

  <p><strong>Cake: </strong>Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease &amp; line a large
  round cake pan or liberally grease a 10&rdquo; or 12&rdquo; cast iron
  pan.</p><p>Whisk together dry ingredients. Combine melted butter, brown sugar,
  honey &amp; buttermilk; beat till well mixed. Add lemon zest &amp; vanilla.
  Beat in eggs one at a time.</p><p>Add half the dry ingredients and mix, then
  add in the second half and mix again.</p><p>Stir jam until it is a runny
  consistency (warm very lightly if needed to achieve runny
  consistency).</p><p>Pour batter into pan. Dollop jam in spots over the batter.
  Gently swirl the jam into the batter.</p><p>Press strawberry halves into the
  batter. I like to leave the strawberries uncovered by batter and alternate
  some cut side up and some cut side down.</p><p>Sprinkle all over with the 2
  Tbsp raw turbinado sugar. Bake approximately 30 mins until
  golden.</p><p><strong>Whip Cream: </strong>While the cake bakes, prepare fresh
  whipped cream: beat together 1 cup heavy cream, 1-2 Tbsp powdered sugar and 1
  tsp vanilla extract for a few minutes, until stiff peaks form.</p><p>Let cake
  cool, then slice and served with whipped cream.</p>
