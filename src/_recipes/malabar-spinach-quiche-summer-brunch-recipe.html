  href="https://4pfoods.com/recipes/italian-easter-spinach-pie/">Italian Easter
  Spinach Pie Recipe</a> by 4P Foodie Tara Hoot has a great pie crust recipe if
  you would like to make your own. Refrigerate the pie crust while you prepare
  the rest of the quiche ingredients. Slice the onion and separate out the
  rings. Mince the garlic cloves and chop the malabar spinach and
  basil.</p><p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Slice your tomato and dab with a
  towel to dry. Crack 6 pasture-raised eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat
  the eggs with the milk until combined. Mix the 2oz. of cheese and the beaten
  eggs together.</p><p>Take the pie crust out of the refrigerator and start
  assembling the layers of the quiche. Put the tomatoes on top of the pie crust
  and season with salt and pepper to taste. Layer the onions on top of the
  tomatoes and then sprinkle in the minced garlic. Add in the malabar spinach
  and then the basil. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the malabar spinach
  and basil. Season and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.</p><p>Bake in the
  400 degree oven for 40 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.</p>
