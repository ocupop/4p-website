  <p>We kicked off November with a 4P Foodies Recipe Contest and asked members
  to submit their favorite fall dish. It was tough to decide over the satisfying
  comfort foods that were submitted, but our team picked 4P Member, Kai&rsquo;s
  recipe for Marinated Mushrooms as the winner. Kai says this about the recipes:
  "My favorite as a child when my mother made this for parties and
  Thanksgiving." Take a page from Kai's book and serve on your next appetizer
  platter or cheese board for a special occassion! Makes a great topping for any
  occasion too&mdash; for toast, salads, soups, sausage roll, tofu stir fry, or
  grilled protein.</p>
