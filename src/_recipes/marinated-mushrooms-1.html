  <p>We kicked off November with a 4P Foodies Recipe Contest and asked members
  to submit their favorite fall dish. It was tough to decide over the satisfying
  comfort foods that were submitted, but our team picked Kai&rsquo;s Marinated
  Mushrooms. Kai says this about the recipes: "My favorite as a child when my
  mother made this for parties and Thanksgiving."</p>
