  <p>RED WINE REDUCTION: Combining all the ingredients into a large, bottom
  heavy stainless steel pot. Bring it to a boil over high heat. Once it is at a
  boil reduce the heat to a simmer for about 45 minutes. Reduce the liquid until
  it turns into a glaze and then strain immediately while it is still hot and
  then clean out the pot to reuse again for the Beef stock reduction.</p><p><br
  />BEEF: &nbsp;Trim away the excess fat from you meat of choice. Cut the meat
  into 2 inch cubes. &nbsp;Then in a bowl season the beef with canola oil, salt,
  and pepper. Sear the meat on all sides in a saut&eacute; pan. Do not over
  crowed the pan or you will steam them rather than brown them. Then Transfer
  them onto a plate with a couple layers of paper towels to absorb all the
  grease but leave the grease in the saut&eacute; pan.</p><p><br />BEEF STOCK
  REDUCTION: Strain the grease into the large, heavy bottom pot you used earlier
  for the wine reduction and bring it to high heat. When the pot is hot enough,
  caramelize the carrots and onions. Then add the Leakes and tomato paste and
  cook until the tomato paste turns brown. Add the remaining ingredients and
  reduce by half (Skim out the impurities, no foam on top and oil). Pre heat
  oven to 325 degrees. Reduced, strain the liquid and place the liquid back into
  the pot (Cleaned) and add the Beef. The beef should be 3/4 covered in liquid
  if it isn&rsquo;t then take the beef out and reduce the liquid further.
  Tightly cover the pot and braise the beef for about 2 hours until it is fork
  tender. It is important to check it every 30 minutes because it is possible
  that it will take a shorter or longer time to cook. Once it is done take out
  the beef and strain out the liquid again into the same pot. Depending on you
  desired consistency of the broth you can reduce it into a thicker sauce so it
  can coat the meat (like in the photo) and vegetables or just leave it as
  is.</p><p>PEARL ONIONS: In a small pot add all the ingredients. Fill it with
  water until it is an inch above the onions and bring it to a boil and cook it
  for 10 to 15 minutes until tender. Once the onions are done peal them and trim
  the ends. Set aside. (Do this task while the Beef stock is reducing)</p><p><br
  />BACON &amp; MUSHROOMS: Place the bacon on a sheet tray with a rack and put
  it in the oven at 325 degrees and rotate every 10 minutes until it is golden
  and crispy. Do this while the Boeuf Bourguignon is cooking in the oven. When
  the bacon is done strain the fat into a saut&eacute; pan and saut&eacute; the
  Mushroom with the rendered bacon fat, salt and pepper. &nbsp;</p><p><br
  />PLATING: Place the meat into your dish of choice then place your vegetables
  neatly on top of the meat. Gently pour the hot jus on top of the meat and
  vegetables slowly. Then add your garnishes (Bacon, Chopped Parsley, etc).</p>

<div class="editable">
          <p>A well loved stew made with beef that&rsquo;s braised in red wine, (often red Burgundy, hence the name) and beef stock flavored with carrots, onions, garlic, and finished with pearl onions, mushrooms, and bacon. You can use any vegetable you may like but make sure you cook it separately and less fat. For a quicker preparation, you may opt to use a packaged beef broth or beef stock, although we recommend making your own for the aroma and flavors! This recipe is suitable for any lean, tough, boneless beef cut&mdash; Top or Bottom Round, Chuck Roast, Arm &nbsp;Roast, Shanks, and Short Ribs, for example. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shop.4pfoods.com/summary.php?go=products&amp;cat=42&amp;12">Shop for beef</a> from our selection of grass-fed and locally raised meat!</p>
