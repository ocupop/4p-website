  <p>In November, we kicked off the first 4P Foodies Recipe Contest and asked
    members to submit their favorite fall dish. Choosing between comfort foods and
    warm Thanksgiving side dishes was as fun as it was difficult. Our team voted
    and Marinated Mushrooms by 4P member, Kai won for their tasty way to preserve
    the flavors of fresh mushrooms found in your 4P bags. &ldquo;My favorite as a
    child when my mother made this for parties and Thanksgiving,&rdquo; says Kai
    about the recipe.</p>
