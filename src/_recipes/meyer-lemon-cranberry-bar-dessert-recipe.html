  <p>When life gives you meyer lemons, make this delicious holiday dessert with
  cranberries. During the winter months, 4P Foods brings in organic citrus from
  trusted independent farms. This winter dessert recipe makes 24 bars and is
  perfect for larger winter gatherings. Meyer Lemons are delightful for cooking
  and baking due to higher sugar and lower acid content than other lemons. Their
  skin is also a lot thinner than other lemons, and has more of an aromatic,
  floral flavor.</p>
ingredients_html: >-
  <p>2 meyer lemons</p><p>1 &frac34;&nbsp; cups all purpose flour</p><p>3 farm
  fresh eggs</p><p>&frac12; tsp. salt</p><p>1 &frac12; tsp. vanilla
  extract</p><p>&frac34; cup unsalted butter, melted</p><p>12 oz. of
  cranberries</p><p>2 1/12 cups granulated sugar</p>
directions_html: >-
  <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a 9x13-inch greased baking
  pan with parchment paper.</p><p>In a saucepan, combine &frac34; cup sugar and
  cranberries along with 3 tablespoons of water and zest both of the meyer
  lemons directly into the pan. Continuously stir and bring the cranberry
  mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. The berries will break open and
  create a jam-like texture. Remove the pan from the heat and set it
  aside.</p><p>Whisk together 1 &frac12; cups flour, â…“ cup sugar, and &frac12;
  tsp. salt in a mixing bowl. In another bowl, whisk the vanilla extract and
  melted butter to combine. Add the butter and vanilla mixture into the flour
  mixture. Mix until the dough comes together in a mass.</p><p>Press the dough
  into the baking pan to create an even layer at the bottom of the pan. Bake for
  about 18 minutes until dry and golden brown. Let cool.</p><p>Squeeze the juice
  from both of the zested lemons.</p><p>Whisk the remaining 1 cup sugar and
  &frac14; cup flour in a mixing bowl until well combined and then gently whisk
  in the farm fresh, pasture-raised eggs. Add the lemon juice and gently stir
  until smooth.</p><p>Once the crust is cool, evenly spread the cranberry
  mixture on top to create the second layer. Then add the lemon mixture on top
  of the cranberries to create the third layer.</p><p>Bake for 20 minutes until
  the filling is set. Let cool completely, and then keep in the refrigerator to
  chill for 2 hours until firm.&nbsp;</p><p>Once firm, remove the bars from the
  pan onto a cutting board and cut into 24 squares.</p>
