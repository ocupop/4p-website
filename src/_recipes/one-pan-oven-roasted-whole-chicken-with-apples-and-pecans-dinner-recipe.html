title: One-pan Oven Roasted Whole Chicken with Apples and Pecans Dinner Recipe
author: 4P Foods Team Member

  <p>This autumn recipe is un-clucking-believable! Sorry for the fowl language,
  but, really, you are going to love this oven roasted whole chicken with apples
  and pecans all fall and winter long. It is comforting and packed with seasonal
  flavor. The local, organic chicken pairs perfectly with Virginia-grown apples.
  All roasted together in one pan, this recipe is great for a holiday gathering
  or family dinner. Depending on the weight of the whole chicken this recipe can
  serve four to six people.</p>

  <p>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Clean the inside of the
  organic whole chicken and pat the outside dry. Mix together the minced garlic
  cloves, thyme, &frac14; cup of your pecans and about a &frac14; of your sliced
  apples. Stuff the chicken with this mixture. Add more apples inside the
  chicken if there is room.</p><p>In a pan grease with butter, line the bottom
  with the rest of the apples and pecans. Place the chicken on top of the apples
  and pecans. Salt and pepper the chicken. Put the pan in the oven for 1 hour
  and 15 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees
  fahrenheit.</p><p>Once the chicken is done, set it on a cutting board to rest
  for at least 15 minutes while you finish the sauce. Add the onion and
  remaining butter to the pan. Mix together gently because the apples will be
  very soft, then place the pan back in the oven for 10 minutes or until the
  butter melts and the onion is no longer raw.</p><p>Carve the chicken and serve
  with the apple, pecan, onion mixture on top or on the side. It's up to
  you!</p><p>Pro tip: One pound of the uncooked chicken is about one serving, so
  if you are cooking for 6 people look for a 6lb whole chicken.</p>
