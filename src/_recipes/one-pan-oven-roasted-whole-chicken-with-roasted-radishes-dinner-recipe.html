  quartered lemons and thyme.</p><p>In a pan grease with butter, line the bottom
  with radishes. Place the chicken on top of the radishes. Salt and pepper the
  chicken. Put the pan in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the
  internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees fahrenheit.</p><p>Allow the

  minutes.</p><p>Carve the chicken and serve with theradishes on top or on the
  side. It's up to you!</p><p>Pro tip: One pound of the uncooked chicken is

  chicken.</p>
