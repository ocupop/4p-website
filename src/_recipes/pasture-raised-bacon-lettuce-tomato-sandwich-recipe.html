  <p>Lettuce tell you about a sandwich called a BLT. Okay, you’ve probably heard
  of it, but we recommend using pasture-raised bacon and in season tomatoes (if
  it is summer and they’re available). This recipe makes one sandwich with
  locally baked sourdough, but feel free to repeat the steps and make sandwiches
  for your friends! A BLT makes for a great lunch and addition to a picnic.</p>
