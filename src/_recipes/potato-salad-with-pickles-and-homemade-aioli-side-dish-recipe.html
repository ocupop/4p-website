  <p>Bring salted water to a boil and add in potatoes. Once potatoes are cooked
  to fork soft, drain them and allow to cool. Once cool, peel and chop the
  potatoes.</p><p>In a different pot, add in three eggs, cover with cold water,
  and then bring that water to a boil. Cover the pot and remove from heat. Allow
  the eggs to sit in the hot water for 10-15 minutes. Drain, let the eggs cool,
  and then peel and rough chop the eggs.</p><p>Chop onion and sweet
  pickles.</p><p>To make aioli, add egg, egg yolk, dijon mustard, lemon juice,
  salt, and garlic to a blender or food processor and pulse to roughly combine.
  Then, turn the blender on slow to medium speed and slowly drizzle in the olive
  oil until the mixture has a smooth consistency. This will make 1 &frac14; cup
  aioli which is a cup more than you need, but it&rsquo;s always good to have
  extra.</p><p>Combine all of the ingredients including the &frac14; cup aioli
  in a large mixing bowl. Cover and refrigerate the potato salad to let it cool
  before serving.</p>
