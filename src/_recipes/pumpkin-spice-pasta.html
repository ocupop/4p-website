  <p>The holiday season is such a fun time filled with love, laughter, and
  holiday cheer. Many of us hold tight to our families' holiday traditions,
  especially when it comes to food. In December we asked you to share your
  ultimate cozy comfort food or best holiday-inspired dish. We had many dishes
  that sounded tantalizing...but only one was selected. We&rsquo;re excited to
  announce December's winner is Mike K. from Washington, D.C. for their Pumpkin

  <p>Start some generously salted water boiling in a pot. Saute 0.5-0.75 lb of
  loose mild or sweet sausage of your choice and about a third of a white onion
  (roughly chopped) until the onion is soft and meat is cooked or browned to
  your liking. Remove from the pan and discard excess oil. I used bison bourbon
  fennel sausage. In an empty pan, add asparagus cut into 1.5" segments, along
  with oil if necessary. Saute until finished and remove from the pan.
  Meanwhile, add a pasta of your choice to the water and continue to boil. Short
  pasta (e.g. ziti) works best, but any will do. Boil until done. Put about 8 oz
  (half a can) of pureed to the pan, now on medium. Once warm, add about 8 oz
  milk (I used whole milk) and stir until mixed. Bring to a simmer. Add your
  pumpkin spices to taste. I used freshly ground nutmeg, ground clove, cinnamon,
  and ginger, along with salt, onion powder, garlic powder and gochugaru.
  Continue simmering until desired sauce thickness is achieved. Remember, it
  will tighten as it cools. Once sauce is done, add sausage mixture, asparagus,
  grated parmigiano reggiano, and pasta, and toss until homogeneous. Spoon into
  a wide bowl and sprinkle with roughly chopped toasted hazelnuts or pistachios.
  Enjoy!</p>
