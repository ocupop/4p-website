  <p>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Place your unwrapped soft rind
  cheese in a shallow baking dish. If you plan on moving the cheese after
  baking, line your baking dish with parchment paper. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.
  Once it is melted all the way through the center, it should feel wobbly when
  lightly touched. Remove from the oven.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are serving it in a
  different container than what you baked it in, transfer to that container
  using the parchment paper to keep the rind from breaking.</p><p>Pour your
  honey on top of the cheese. Add your apple and other toppings. Serve with
  crackers or crusty bread. Break the rind with a cheese knife and watch all of
  the beautiful ooey-gooey-ness.</p>
