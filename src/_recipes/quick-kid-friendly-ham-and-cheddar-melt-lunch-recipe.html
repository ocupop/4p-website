  <p>This kid-friendly recipe gets cheddar and cheddar. A ham and cheddar melt
  made with salty country ham and Vermont cheddar cheese sticks is a delicious
  lunch option year round. Whether you have kids or are a kid at heart,
  shredding the cheddar cheese sticks by hand is a fun way to not dirty up a
  knife. Plus, the cheddar cheese sticks are free from hormones, antibiotics,
  and preservatives. Add-ons include apple butter if you like a sweet and salty
  or mustard if you want a little spice. This recipe serves 1 to 2 people.</p>

  <p>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Place your greek style
  pita on a baking sheet. If you are using apple butter for a sweet addition to
  your melt or mustard for a spicy addition, spread that on top of the pita
  bread.</p><p>Slice your ham into bite sized pieces and place it on the pita in
  an even layer.</p><p>Slice the cheese stick(s) into smaller pieces to get an
  even layer of melted cheese on top. If your kids are helping, allow them to
  shred the cheese sticks with their fingers. <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You can
  also shred the cheese with your fingers as an adult that doesn’t want to dirty
  up a knife. Place the cheese on top of the ham in an even layer.</p><p>Place
  your assembled melt into the oven until your cheese is melted to your liking (
  about 10-15 minutes). Add greens on top for a bit of veggies and extra
  nutrients if you like.</p>
