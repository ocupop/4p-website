title: Quick Organic Hummus & Pickled Carrot Pita Wrap Lunch Recipe
author: 4P Foods Team Member
description_html: >-
  <p>Delicious organic hummus and pickled carrots on a locally made greek style
  pita! This recipe is simple to make and packed with flavor. The ingredients
  are mostly available all year, but the cucumber and cherry tomatoes may need
  to be substituted or left out of the wrap. Pasture-raised chicken works great
  in this recipe, but organic tofu or humanely-raised beef would taste delicious
  as well. This recipe serves one person, but you will want to re-pita it and
  make more.</p>
