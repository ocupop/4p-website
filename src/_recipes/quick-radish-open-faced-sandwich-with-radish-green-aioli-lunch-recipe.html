title: Quick Radish Open-Faced Sandwich with Radish Green Aioli Lunch Recipe
author: 4P Foods Team Member
description_html: >-
  <p>This recipe would be totally rad(ish) for a spring picnic or just a quick
  lunch. You will need a mandoline to slice the radishes thin enough to turn
  them into more of a seasoning than a textural element. You will also need a
  blender or food processor to create the radish green aioli. This recipe
  creates one open-faced sandwich, but it could be cut into smaller pieces to
  create finger sandwiches.</p>
ingredients_html: "<ul><li>1 bunch of radishes with greens attached</li><li>1 greek style pita bread</li><li>1 garlic clove, roughly chopped</li><li>½ lemon</li><li>¾ cup olive oil</li><li>¼ tsp. salt</li><li>½ tsp. dijon mustard</li><li>1 pasture-raised egg<br />\_</li></ul>"

  <p>Separate the greens from the radish. Roughly chop the leaves and discard
  the stems. Add the radish leaves, garlic clove, salt, egg, and dijon mustard
  to a blender or food processor. Squeeze the half lemon juice into the blender
  or food processor. Blitz the ingredients a couple of times to roughly combine.
  Then, turn the blender or food processor on low to medium speed and slowly
  pour in the oil. Keep blending until smooth.</p><p>Warm your pita in the oven
  at 350 degrees Fahrenheit to prepare it for the base of your sandwich. Make
  sure it doesn’t get crispy, you just want it to be slightly warm and
  fluffy.</p><p>Use the mandoline to slice the radish very thin. Be careful and
  follow all safety instructions that come with your mandoline.</p><p>Time to
  build your sandwich! Spread the aioli on top of the pita and then layer your
  thinly sliced radishes on top of the aioli. Sprinkle it with salt and
  enjoy!</p>
