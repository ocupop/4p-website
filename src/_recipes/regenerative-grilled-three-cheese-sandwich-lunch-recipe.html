  <p>Regenerative cheese is grate! ORIGIN cheese is the perfect in this three
  cheese grilled sandwich. Regenerative and organic made from 100% A2 milk
  sourced exclusively from pasture-raised Guernsey cows, ORIGIN cheese checks a
  lot of boxes plus it tastes delicious. This comforting recipe is great all
  year round, but especially yummy in the winter months when itâ€™s cold out.</p>

  sourdough. The buttered sides will be on the outside of the
  sandwich.&nbsp;</p><p>Place one slice of the sourdough bread butter side down
  in the skillet. Layer on your cheese slices. Then, add the last slice of
  sourdough on top with the butter side up.</p><p>Let the bread toast as you
  press down on the sandwich with a spatula. When the cheese looks slightly
  melted, flip your sandwich over to toast the other side.</p>
