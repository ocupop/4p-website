  cheese grilled sandwich. Regenerative and organic made from 100% A2 milk
  sourced exclusively from pasture-raised Guernsey cows, ORIGIN cheese checks a
  lot of boxes plus it tastes delicious. This comforting recipe is great all
  year round, but especially yummy in the winter months when it’s cold out.</p>

  in the skillet. Layer on your cheese slices. Then, add the last slice of
  sourdough on top with the butter side up.</p><p>Let the bread toast as you
