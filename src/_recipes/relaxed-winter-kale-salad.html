title: Relaxed Winter Kale Salad

description_html: >-
  <p>March is a time of the year when our winter root veggies start to pile up
  in our pantries and fridges, so I like to incorporate a few of them in this
  recipe, using kale, which is delicious in salad but needs a little special
  handling compared to lettuce.</p>
ingredients_html: >-
  <p><strong>For Salad:</strong></p><ul><li>1 Bunch Kale</li><li>Bonnie&rsquo;s
  Roasted Beets (recipe below)&nbsp;</li><li>1 Celeriac Root</li><li>Dried fruit
  or one apple sliced</li><li>Nuts (your call! I prefer walnut but almonds,
  pecans, and sunflower seeds are also great)</li><li>Salad dressing (I prefer a
  vinaigrette, but it&rsquo;s your salad, you do you!) 4PFoods carries some
  delicious vinaigrette dressings from <a

  Dressing</a> - the blackberry one is my fav</li></ul><p><strong>For
  Bonnie&rsquo;s Roasted Beets:</strong></p><ul><li>3-5 beets (depending on size
  and how much you want)</li><li>Olive Oil</li><li>Balsamic
  Vinegar</li><li>Salt&nbsp;</li><li>Pepper</li><li>Parsley (optional</li></ul>

  <p>First, I rinse the beets and cut off the little ends. Pre-heat the oven to
  <strong>400 degrees</strong>. In a casserole dish or pan big enough for them I
  add some olive oil, and a little balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, and parsley
  on top. I usually turn the beets over and do seasoning on both sides, and then
  wrap them up with some aluminum foil on top. I find they cook better this
  way.</p><p>They usually take about an hour to cook, but I would check every
  <strong>20-30 minutes</strong> to flip them over, to avoid scorching them.
  Then when they seem nice and soft, take them out and let them cool. When you
  are ready to make the salad, cut them into little pieces!</p><p>Next, the
  <strong>kale</strong>!&nbsp;</p><p>The key to a good kale salad is to make
  sure it&rsquo;s relaxed. I know&hellip; what? Have you ever had a delicious
  kale salad at a restaurant and then try to make it yourself and it just
  doesn&rsquo;t taste as good? That&rsquo;s because the kale is stressed. You
  have to massage your kale!</p><p>Since kale is a tougher and more fibrous
  green, it needs a little massaging to break it down and make it more tender
  and easier to chew and digest. You can do this by just rinsing the kale in
  water as you usually would and taking one handful at a time and gently
  massaging for a minute or two... No need to pulverize it. As long as you feel
  the veins breaking down a little, you&rsquo;re good!</p><p>Some folks will
  massage it with olive oil or lemon to give it some flavor, but I just use
  water since I&rsquo;ll add a delicious dressing later. Your call.</p><p>Ok,
  the kale is relaxed now. Happy kale.</p><p>I prefer to have my salads to be
  versatile, so change the ingredients as you see fit. Maybe you prefer a more
  sweet, nutty, or savory salad, or want to add some chicken, tuna, chickpeas,
  or tofu for some extra protein... Go wild!</p><p>For this one, I chopped the
  edges off a giant celeriac root (since they have a lot of knots) and cut the
  celeriac root into little pieces for the salad. I tossed that in with the
  kale, roasted beets, and added some diced walnuts and golden raisins. You can
  also slice up an apple if you like sweetness like me. Then serve with your
  favorite dressing!&nbsp;</p><p>Makes 2-4 servings</p>

          <p>Beets are my favorite veggie and the star of this winter kale salad! Here's a tip for cooking beets: I used to cut them up first but discovered that the edges would get burnt a lot&hellip; then I slowly realized that I could just roast them whole and cut them later! I like to do this first, long before I make the salad so I can let them cool when they are done.</p>
