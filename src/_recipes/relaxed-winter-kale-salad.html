  <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Rinse the beets and cut off the
  ends. In a casserole dish or pan add some olive oil, and a little balsamic
  vinegar, salt, pepper, and parsley on top.Turn the beets over to season on
  both sides, and then cover with aluminum foil on top.</p><p>Cook for 1 hour
  flipping the beets at the 30 minute mark to cook them evenly. Once soft,
  remove from the oven and allow to cool.</p><p>Next, the kale! Massage your
  kale to make it less fibrous. You can do this by just rinsing the kale in
  water as you usually would and taking one handful at a time and gently
  massaging for a minute or two... No need to pulverize it. As long as you feel
  the veins breaking down a little, you&rsquo;re good! Optional to massage it
  with olive oil or lemon to give it some flavor.</p><p>Chop the edges off a
  giant celeriac root (since they have a lot of knots) and dice the celeriac
  root for the salad. I tossed that in with the kale, roasted beets, and added
  some diced walnuts and golden raisins. You can also slice up an apple if you
  like sweetness like me. Then serve with your favorite dressing! This makes 2-4
  servings.</p>
