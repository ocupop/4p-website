title: Roasted Butternut Squash, Red Grapes, and Sage
author: Sandy Tribendis, Office Manager At 4P Foods
description_html: >-
  <p>This recipe has been one of my favorite seasonal side dishes since the fall
  of 2012. I attended a meditation retreat in a beautiful rural setting in
  Stockton NJ. Attendees were asked to bring a vegetarian dish to share. My
  friends were surprised by the delicious flavors of the caramelized onions,
  roasted grapes and how well they combined with the butternut squash, fresh
  sage and pine nuts. It's also an easy recipe to make by roasting it all on a
  cookie sheet. After the retreat I had many requests for the recipe, so here it
  is to share with a new audience!</p>
