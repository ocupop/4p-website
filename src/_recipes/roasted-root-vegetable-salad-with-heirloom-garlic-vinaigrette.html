                <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
                <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place butter on a large baking sheet and place in oven, just until butter is melted. Check after 30 seconds. Swirl butter around the pan and add squash, sweet potato, and beets.&nbsp; Sprinkle &frac14; tsp salt on vegetables and toss to incorporate butter and salt. Place pan in the oven and bake for 35 minutes, stirring vegetables halfway through baking time. While vegetables are roasting, mix together dijon, pepper, &frac12; tsp salt and garlic with RR&amp;Co Heirloom Garlic Oxymel. Whisk in olive oil until well blended. Set aside.</p>
                <p>After 35 minutes, sprinkle arugula on top of roasted veggies and place in the oven for 3 more minutes. Remove from oven. Add cooked rice to the pan and sprinkle half of the vinaigrette on the rice and vegetables. Stir gently to combine. Serve the remaining vinaigrette on the side. Add additional salt and pepper as desired.</p>
