    <p>Cut or break off the florets of the broccoli into small pieces for the
    salad. Dice the apples and red onion and add them to the broccoli in a large
    bowl. Add in sliced almonds and dried cranberries to the salad. You can get
    creative and use chopped walnuts or pumpkin seeds instead of sliced almonds,
    or golden raisins instead of dried cranberries.</p><p>Prepare the dressing
    by mixing the olive oil, tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, dijon mustard,
    salt, and pepper. Taste and adjust as needed based on your
    preference.</p><p>Pour the dressing on top of the salad and mix until the
    broccoli, apple, and red onion is well coated. You can serve right away or
    keep in the fridge before serving.</p>
