  <p>Kale yeah! Weâ€™re keeping it simple on this one plus it is a pretty quick
  prep and cook time. Crispy kale makes a great snack or side dish for lunch. A
  delicious vegetarian option for getting more fiber and vitamin A. We suggest
  curly kale for this recipe, but you can use any other type of kale if you
  like. Just make sure you have 1 bunch to get the 4- servings on the sheet pan.
  Add this snack to your fall and winter menu!</p>
ingredients_html: >-
  <ul><li><p>1 bunch curly kale (other types of kale can be
  used)</p></li><li><p>1 tbsp. olive oil</p></li><li><p>Salt to
  taste</p></li><li><p>Any other spices you like</p></li></ul>
directions_html: >-
  <p>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, line a baking sheet with
  parchment paper.</p><p>In a large bowl, add your roughly chopped kale with the
  stems removed, olive oil, salt, and any other spices you want. Massage your
  kale by scrunching it in your hands. This breaks down some of the fibers
  making it easier to digest.</p><p>Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes or
  until the edges of the kale turn brown. Turn your oven off and allow the kale
  to crisp up for another 3 minutes in the cooling oven.</p><p>Remove your kale,
  taste, and add more spices if needed. Happy snacking!</p>
