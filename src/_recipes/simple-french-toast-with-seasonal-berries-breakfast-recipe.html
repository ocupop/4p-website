  <p>A toast to breakfast and simple Sunday mornings! This French toast recipe
  is deliciously simple and packed with local ingredients. We suggest adding in
  season berries in the spring or berry jam that preserves the peak season
  flavor the rest of the year. You will need a shallow dish for dipping the
  sourdough in the egg mixture and a whisk to mix up your egg mixture. You will
  also need a frying pan to fry up this exquisite breakfast dish. This recipe
  serves 2 people, but can easily be scaled up for a brunch party.</p>
