  <ul><li>Warm a grill to medium high heat or set your air fryer with the grill
  pan to the grill setting at 400 degrees. Grill the sliced peaches for about 5
  minutes on each side until charred and tender. Remove from the grill and let
  cool.</li><li>Meanwhile, wash and massage your kale. Simply scrunch the kale
  up in your hand as you rinse. You will feel the fibers breaking down. Drain
  well.</li><li><strong>Pro Tip: Since kale is a tougher and more fibrous green,
  it needs a little massaging to break it down and make it more tender and
  easier to chew and digest.</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>In a bowl, add your kale,
  blueberries, and grilled peaches. Drizzle the honey on top. Add a splash of
  the Better Than Balsamic Vinegar and salt and black pepper to taste. Toss the
  salad to mix and ENJOY!</li></ul>
