  the flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. In another mixing bowl,

  the dough into 1-inch balls with a spoon or ice cream scoop and roll in sugar.
  Place on the cookie sheets spaced out so the cookies won’t touch. Press a
  thumbprint into the center of each ball and scoop locally-made strawberry jam
  into the thumbprint.</p><p>Bake cookies for 15 minutes. Then, allow the
  cookies to cool on the cookie sheets before serving. You can store cookies in
  a tightly sealed container for about five days.</p>
