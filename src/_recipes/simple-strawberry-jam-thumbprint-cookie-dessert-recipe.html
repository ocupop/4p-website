  <p>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare two baking sheets with
  parchment paper or reusable silicone cookie sheet liners.</p><p>Whisk together
  the flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. In another mixing bowl,
  use a hand-held mixer to whip the unsalted butter and the sugar together until
  fluffy. Then, whisk&nbsp; in the pasture-raised egg and vanilla until just
  combined. Slowly whisk in the dry ingredients just until combined.</p><p>Scoop
  the dough into 1-inch balls with a spoon or ice cream scoop and roll in sugar.
  Place on the cookie sheets spaced out so the cookies wonâ€™t touch. Press a
  thumbprint into the center of each ball and scoop locally-made strawberry jam
  into the thumbprint.</p><p>Bake cookies for 15 minutes. Then, allow the
  cookies to cool on the cookie sheets before serving. You can store cookies in
  a tightly sealed container for about five days.</p>
