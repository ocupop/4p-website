author: 4P Foods
description_html: >-
  <p>Grilled Spring turnips are smoky and delicious, so turnip for early Spring
  vegetables! This vegetarian appetizer recipe serves four people and is great
  for Spring barbeques, small gatherings, and parties. If the Spring weather
  isn&rsquo;t nice enough for grilling, you can use your air fryer grill pan or
  your oven to cook the turnips.</p><p>The aioli made with pasture-raised farm
  fresh eggs and organic lemons brightens up the smokiness of the grilled
  turnips. The turnips can be cut into thin discs for dipping while snacking or
  thicker pieces for skewering on kabobs for a vegetarian side dish. This
  Grilled Spring Turnip Appetizer Recipe with lemon aioli is a versatile recipe
  that can be used with other in season root vegetables like Summer radishes and
  Fall parsnips.</p>
