author: 4P Foods
description_html: >-
  <p>Fire up the grill for an early season cookout with spring turnips! To
  prepare indoors, oven roast the turnips at 400&deg; for 30 minutes or until
  slightly tender, which will vary depending on the size. Simply cut turnips in
  half or quarter after peeling the skin, if you have larger roots on hand. Save
  any extra lemon aioli to use in sandwich, burger, dip for carrot sticks, or
  any place a flavorful condiment is needed!</p>

  <p><strong>Aioli:</strong> Place all ingredients, except oil, into blender
  then slowly add oil while blending, allowing the ingredients to emulsify into
  a smooth homogenous sauce. This is a great job for your handheld immersion
  blender or small to medium-sized blender. Season with salt and pepper to
  taste.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Turnips: </strong>Wash and peel. Cut into
  1/4&rdquo; disks. Toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, smoked paprika. Grill on
  high, 2-4 minutes on each side until tender. Alternatively, cut into 1&rdquo;
  chunks and skewer to make kebabs. This recipe is versatile &mdash; try it with
  radishes!<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Makes 4 servings.</p>
