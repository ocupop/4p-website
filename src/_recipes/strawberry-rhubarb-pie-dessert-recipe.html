  <p>For the pie crust, combine 2 ½ cups all purpose flour, 1 tsp. Salt, and 2
  tsp. sugar in a large bowl. Using a pastry cutter, add 1 cup unsalted butter
  to the dry mixture. Slowly add in the cold water one tablespoon at a time to
  the dry mixture until a shaggy dough forms. Allow the dough to rest in the
  refrigerator for 2 hours.</p><p>PRO TIP: You can batch make pie crust dough
  and keep it in an airtight in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p><p>Preheat
  the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine
  rhubarb, strawberries, maple syrup, corn starch, ⅓ cup granulated sugar, ¼
  teaspoon salt, and 2 tbsp. orange juice. Stir and let sit while you prepare
  the pie crust.</p><p>Remove your pie crust from the refrigerator and cut it in
  half. One half is for the bottom of the pie and the other is for the top. Roll
  your pie crust out on a floured surface. Turn the dough a quarter turn after
  every roll to keep the shape in a circle. Once you reach the size of your 9
  inch pie plate, press the dough into the bottom of the pie
  plate.</p><p>Carefully spoon in the filling mixture and leave behind the
  excess watery part of the mixture in the bowl. You don’t want your mixture to
  be too watery.</p><p>Roll out the top half of the pie crust using the same
  quarter turn method. You can have a solid pie crust on top, cut the dough into
  strips and weave it, or cut shapes out of the top piece of pie crust. Get
  creative and show your style, but be sure to crimp the outer edges of the pie
  crust with a fork to keep them together.</p><p>Bake the pie at 400 degrees
  Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. Then, while the pie is still in the oven, lower the
  temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for an additional 30 minutes.
  You can cover the crust edges with aluminum foil or a pie crust shield if you
  are worried it might burn.</p><p>Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to
  cool for 2 hours. It’s a long time to wait, but if you don't, the filling
  won’t set.</p><p>Enjoy with ice cream!</p>
