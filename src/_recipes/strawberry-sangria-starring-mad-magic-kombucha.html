  <p>Add the diced strawberries and the unpeeled orange slices to a large punch
  bowl or pitcher. Muddle them with a muddler for about a minute. If you don't
  have a muddler, not to worry! Get creative with a substitute kitchen tool to
  smash the orange slices against the bottom of the punch bowl or pitcher, like
  a fork.</p><p>Add in the orange juice and Mad Magic Strawberry Kombucha and
  muddle everything again to combine for about 30 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>Why use
  kombucha? This flavor enhances the strawberry vibe while adding powerful
  probiotics to your Spring happy hour, party, or Summer barbeque. We added 1/4
  cup in this recipe but you can add up to 1/2 cup for more flavor!</p><p>Add
  your chilled bottle of dry red wine and stir to incorporate. Choose a dry red
  wine for this recipe. Mix all ingredients together and chill until ready to
  enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Serve in a cup with ice and fruit garnish.</p><p>Tips for
  adjusting the flavor to taste:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Add more Strawberry Kombucha,
  strawberries, orange, orange juice to achieve the balance of fruit and
  sweet.&nbsp;</li><li>For sweet sangria, add 1-2 tablespoons of maple syrup for
  sweeter sangria.</li></ul><p>Recipe courtesy of <a
