  <p><strong>Fruit:</strong>&nbsp;Add the diced strawberries and the unpeeled
  orange slices to a large mixing bowl or pitcher and muddle them with a muddler
  for about a minute. If you don't have a muddler, not to worry! Get creative
  with a substitute kitchen tool to smash the orange slices against the bottom
  of a tall glass, like a fork.</p><p>Add in the orange juice and Mad Magic
  Strawberry Kombucha and muddle everything again to combine for about 30
  seconds.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kombucha:</strong>&nbsp;This flavor enhances the
  strawberry vibe while adding powerful probiotics to your happy hour cheers. We
  added 1/4 cup in this recipe but you can add up to 1/2 cup for more
  flavor!</p><p><strong>Wine:</strong>&nbsp;Add your chilled bottle of dry red
  wine and stir to incorporate. Choose an inexpensive, dry bottle for this
  recipe. Mix all ingredients together and chill until ready to enjoy. Serve in
  a cup with ice and fruit garnish.</p><p><strong>Tips for adjusting the flavor
  to taste:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Add more Strawberry Kombucha,
  strawberries, orange, orange juice to achieve the balance of fruit and
  sweet.&nbsp;</li><li>For sweet sangria, add 1-2 tablespoons of maple syrup for
  sweeter sangria.</li></ul><p>Recipe courtesy of Mad Magic Kombucha. Make this
