  <p>Shrubs for Summer! Shrubs are drinking vinegars that have been around for
  centuries. Before refrigeration was commonplace, the vinegar in Shrubs would
  preserve fruits and herbs, extending the seasons to enjoy these fresh plants.
  As refrigeration became more commonplace in homes, the need for vinegar drink
  preservation decreased and these older world cookery traditions fell to the
  wayside. Beverages that were sweeter, contained fresh juices and were
  pasteurized supplanted these age-old drinks, but vinegar and our attraction to
  it&rsquo;s mouth-puckering sourness is locked in our taste buds and cultural
  heritage. With a brief absence from mainstream food and beverage, our bodies
  missed these tart concoctions. To no surprise, Shrubs and other vinegar
  infusions have been recalled from the past into kitchens and restaurants,
  enjoyed in the present and continue to grow as household recipes for the
  future. ⁠</p>
