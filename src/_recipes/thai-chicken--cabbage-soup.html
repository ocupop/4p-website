title: Thai Chicken & Cabbage Soup

  <p>The New Year is finally here, and many have vowed to turn over a new leaf
  in their diet! As a Functional Nutritional Therapy Practitioner, one of the
  biggest mistakes I see in clients is their thirst for a quick fix without
  first examining the primary foundation of their health: digestion. Digestion
  supports the function of the entire body. Approximately 70-80% of your immune
  system resides in your digestive tract. When digestion is impaired, it has a
  negative effect on all other systems and may be an underlying cause of
  numerous health issues.</p><p>One food to help repair your gut is cabbage. In
  fact, it is so great for you it created its own &ldquo;vitamin&rdquo;: Vitamin
  U. It is not a true vitamin, but a derivative of the essential amino acid:
  methionine.&nbsp; A doctor in the 1950s coined the term after discovering the
  nutrients in raw cabbage juice proved to repair peptic ulcers (U for ulcer!)
  and cells in the gut lining. Ready to fall in love with cabbage this season?
