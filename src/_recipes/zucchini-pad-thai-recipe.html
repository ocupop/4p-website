  <p>A simple spring or summer lunch recipe that you will be soy into! All you
  need is a stove, a pot and a large mixing bowl to create a delicious lite
  lunch or the perfect side dish for grilled protein. This recipe serves four to
  six people, but can easily be scaled up or down depending on if you are having
  date night or a dinner party. Make this recipe your own by adding avocado,
  toasted and chopped peanuts or cashews, or crispy shallots. Drop the honey and
  fish sauce to make this a yummy vegan side dish. You can also take this recipe
  idea and apply it to many seasonal vegetables like using radishes instead of
  carrots, shredded kohlrabi instead of cabbage, or spiralized beets or sweet
  potatoes instead of zucchini!</p>
ingredients_html: >-
  <ul><li>3 small zucchini, spiralized or 4-5 cups prepared zucchini noodles aka
  &ldquo;zoodles&rdquo;</li><li>~&frac14; of a medium cabbage (preferably red),
  very finely sliced cabbage (2-3 cups)</li><li>2 carrots, shredded (~1
  cup)</li><li>1 garlic scape or 1 small garlic clove, finely
  chopped</li><li>2-3 scallions, sliced (use the whole thing, from the white to
  the green tops)</li><li>A big handful of cilantro, roughly chopped (or less or
  none if you don&rsquo;t love cilantro)</li><li>1 package frozen
  edamame</li><li>3-4 tbsp citrus juice, from 1-2 limes and/or 1 lemon (use
  whatever you have or a mix if your limes are dry; could also use 2-3 tbsp rice
  wine vinegar)</li><li>1-2 tbsp soy sauce</li><li>1-2 tsp fish sauce (omit for
  vegan)</li><li>1-2 tsp hot sauce of your choice</li><li>Pinch of coconut sugar
  or brown sugar or a splash of honey</li><li>4 tbsp tahini or peanut
  butter</li></ul>
directions_html: >-
  <p>Prepare all of your veggies, garlic, and herbs, putting them in a large
  bowl as you go. Cook your edamame in a pot of boiling salted water. When
  it&rsquo;s done, rinse under cold water or chill in an ice bath to
  cool.</p><p>Make the dressing by combining citrus juice (or vinegar), soy
  sauce, fish sauce (if using), hot sauce, and tahini or peanut butter in a
  small bowl; whisk until smooth.&nbsp;</p><p>Tip: if using peanut butter,
  thinning the peanut butter with a small amount of the liquid ingredients will
  make it easier to whisk everything together into a smooth
  sauce.&nbsp;</p><p>Taste and adjust as needed to get a bright, tangy dressing
  that suits your taste.</p><p>Add the cooked and cooled edamame to the bowl,
  pour the dressing over, and toss thoroughly to coat.&nbsp;</p><p>Taste again,
  seasoning with more soy sauce or citrus or hot sauce as desired. Optional
  toppings include: avocado, toasted and chopped peanuts or cashews, and crispy
  shallots. Enjoy!</p>
