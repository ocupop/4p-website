title: Simple Zucchini Pad Thai Lunch Recipe
author: 4P Foods Team Member
description_html: >-
  <p><em>This is a super-easy, bright dish that makes a light meal or pretty
  side to grilled meat. It uses up lots of produce, with quick-cooking edamame
  thrown in for its tender bite and plant-based protein. Better yet for summer:
  no stove or oven required if you cook the edamame in the microwave! No need to
  stick exactly to the recipe &mdash; it&rsquo;s flexible enough to accommodate
  whatever is in your fridge. Use radishes instead of carrots, shredded kohlrabi
  instead of cabbage, or spiralized beets or sweet potatoes instead of zucchini!
  Best eaten 20-30 minutes after dressing so that the veggies have a chance to
  soften. Makes great leftovers.</em></p>
ingredients_html: >-
  <ul><li>3 small zucchini, spiralized or 4-5 cups prepared zucchini noodles aka
  &ldquo;zoodles&rdquo;</li><li>~&frac14; of a medium cabbage (preferably red),
  very finely sliced cabbage (2-3 cups)</li><li>2 carrots, shredded (~1
  cup)</li><li>1 garlic scape or 1 small garlic clove, finely
  chopped</li><li>2-3 scallions, sliced (use the whole thing, from the white to
  the green tops)</li><li>A big handful of cilantro, roughly chopped (or less or
  none if you don&rsquo;t love cilantro)</li><li>1 package frozen
  edamame</li><li>3-4 tbsp citrus juice, from 1-2 limes and/or 1 lemon (use
  whatever you have or a mix if your limes are dry; could also use 2-3 tbsp rice
  wine vinegar)</li><li>1-2 tbsp soy sauce</li><li>1-2 tsp fish sauce (omit for
  vegan)</li><li>1-2 tsp hot sauce of your choice</li><li>Pinch of coconut sugar
  or brown sugar or a splash of honey</li><li>4 tbsp tahini or peanut
  butter</li></ul>
directions_html: >-
  <p>Prepare all of your veggies, garlic, and herbs, putting them in a large
  bowl as you go. Cook your edamame in a pot of boiling salted water. When
  it&rsquo;s done, rinse under cold water or chill in an ice bath to
  cool.</p><p>Make the dressing by combining citrus juice (or vinegar), soy
  sauce, fish sauce (if using), hot sauce, and tahini or peanut butter in a
  small bowl; whisk until smooth.&nbsp;</p><p>Tip: if using peanut butter,
  thinning the peanut butter with a small amount of the liquid ingredients will
  make it easier to whisk everything together into a smooth
  sauce.&nbsp;</p><p>Taste and adjust as needed to get a bright, tangy dressing
  that suits your taste.</p><p>Add the cooked and cooled edamame to the bowl,
  pour the dressing over, and toss thoroughly to coat.&nbsp;</p><p>Taste again,
  seasoning with more soy sauce or citrus or hot sauce as desired. Optional
  toppings include: avocado, toasted and chopped peanuts or cashews, and crispy
  shallots. Enjoy!</p>
