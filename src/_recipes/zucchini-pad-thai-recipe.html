  <p><em>This is a super-easy, bright dish that makes a light meal or pretty
  side to grilled meat. It uses up lots of produce, with quick-cooking edamame
  thrown in for its tender bite and plant-based protein. Better yet for summer:
  no stove or oven required if you cook the edamame in the microwave! No need to
  stick exactly to the recipe &mdash; it&rsquo;s flexible enough to accommodate
  whatever is in your fridge. Use radishes instead of carrots, shredded kohlrabi
  instead of cabbage, or spiralized beets or sweet potatoes instead of zucchini!
  Best eaten 20-30 minutes after dressing so that the veggies have a chance to
  soften. Makes great leftovers.</em></p>
ingredients_html: >-
  <ul><li>3 small zucchini, spiralized or 4-5 cups prepared zucchini noodles aka
  &ldquo;zoodles&rdquo;</li><li>~&frac14; of a medium cabbage (preferably red),
  very finely sliced cabbage (2-3 cups)</li><li>2 carrots, shredded (~1
  cup)</li><li>1 garlic scape or 1 small garlic clove, finely
  chopped</li><li>2-3 scallions, sliced (use the whole thing, from the white to
  the green tops)</li><li>A big handful of cilantro, roughly chopped (or less or
  none if you don&rsquo;t love cilantro)</li><li>1 package frozen
  edamame</li><li>3-4 tbsp citrus juice, from 1-2 limes and/or 1 lemon (use
  whatever you have or a mix if your limes are dry; could also use 2-3 tbsp rice
  wine vinegar)</li><li>1-2 tbsp soy sauce</li><li>1-2 tsp fish sauce (omit for
  vegan)</li><li>1-2 tsp sambal oelek, or hot sauce of your choice</li><li>Pinch
  of coconut sugar or brown sugar or a sploosh of honey</li><li>4 tbsp tahini or
  peanut butter</li><li>Optional toppings: avocado, toasted and chopped peanuts
  or cashews, crispy shallots</li></ul>
directions_html: >-
  <ol><li>If you&rsquo;re going to cook your edamame on the stove, start by
  putting on a pot of salted water to boil.</li><li>Prepare all of your veggies,
  garlic, and herbs, putting them in a large bowl as you go.</li><li>Cook
  edamame according to package directions, either on the stove or in the
  microwave. When it&rsquo;s done, rinse under cold water or chill in an ice
  bath to cool.</li><li>While edamame cooks, make the dressing by combining
  citrus juice (or vinegar), soy sauce, fish sauce (if using), hot sauce, and
  tahini or peanut butter in a small bowl; whisk until smooth. (Tip: if using
  peanut butter, thinning the peanut butter with a small amount of the liquid
  ingredients will make it easier to whisk everything together into a smooth
  sauce.) Taste and adjust as needed to get a bright, tangy dressing that suits
  your taste.</li><li>Add the cooked and cooled edamame to the bowl, pour the
  dressing over, and toss thoroughly to coat (hands work best for this!). Taste
  again, seasoning with more soy sauce or citrus or hot sauce as desired.
  Enjoy!</li></ol>
