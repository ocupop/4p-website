            During her college years at Wake Forest, Amy became interested in food through a campus food recovery and meal distribution program. She learned about the many gaps in the current food system that allow for immense amounts of food waste and food insecurity and became passionate about the topic of food justice. She saw the need to work to make the food system more equitable for everyone including the farmers growing the food.<p></p>
            <p>Amy’s passion for food system change led her to working as the Director of Procurement and Sustainability for DC Central Kitchen (DCCK) for 14 years. Through that role, she managed all the sourcing for DCCK including their sourcing for Farm-to-School contracts. She developed partnerships with local farmers and food hubs, including 4P Foods and gained a strong understanding of how to source for a school food program.</p>
            <p>She is bringing her knowledge of K12 nutrition programs and experience working with local farms to her role at 4P Foods. “I am really excited to be able to focus on farm to school and bring delicious local food to school kids,” said Amy.</p>
