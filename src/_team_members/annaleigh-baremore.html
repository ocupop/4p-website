            <p>It was Annaleigh&rsquo;s belief that improving both human health and the livelihoods of small farms and businesses starts with good food access that brought her to 4P Foods. She has a background in environmental and plant sciences, agriculture, and farmers market management, and loves to spend time outdoors (preferably working in the garden), trying new foods, listening to live music, and spending time with family and friends. Annaleigh started with 4P Foods in October of 2021. Read more on her <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaleigh-baremore-307254113/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
