            <p>I am a recovering capitalist who spent the first part of my career helping rich corporations get richer before escaping to sail around the world for two decades with my husband and partner in adventure and life. In those years, I learned to value all of the things in this world that cannot be priced - sunsets and dolphins, glaciers and mountains, storms and calms, clean air and healthy oceans. 4P has given me an opportunity to use my skills and talents to help build an organization that measures more than profits and values People, Planet and Prosperity equally.</p>
