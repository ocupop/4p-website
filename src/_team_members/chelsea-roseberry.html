            <p>Chelsea recently joined 4P in September, bringing with her a passion for local food, and decade of experience managing farmers markets and farm stores across the region. Her role is largely focused on the produce procurement strategy, with the goal of aligning customer needs and farmer product availability to maximize local food sales. She believes every dollar spent locally gets us a step closer to a healthy and sustainable food system. In her downtime she enjoys perusing a farmers market, cooking, and practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p>
