  He admittedly is not a huge veggie guy, unless we are talking pizza toppings,
  but his favorite stand alone vegetable is brussels sprouts.

            <p>Chris came to 4P Foods by way of Justin &ndash; a good referral goes a long way here. He&rsquo;s what one might call a &ldquo;connoisseur&rdquo; of pizza, and professional wrestling. Since joining the 4P Foods team, he has come to appreciate the tastiness of food outside the crust. Rosemary from our friends at Dreaming Out Loud had Chris eager to cook something, anything, with that aromatic herb!</p>
            <p>Chris helps with one of the most important roles here at 4P Foods&hellip; bringing our bags to our members. If you see him on his delivery route, be sure to give him a high five or a hug or both. Odds are he was up at 2:00 in the morning and is in the middle of a 12-hour day to make the magic of local food delivery happen.</p>
