            <p>Devon Byrne has a diverse background in local food systems, first stemming from her studies at the University of Vermont, where she became intrigued with the connection between food, environmental conservation, and human health. She most recently worked on farm to school efforts in the Boston area, on a sustainable ranch in Colorado, and here in Charlottesville as a Functional Nutritional Therapy Practitioner. She often recommends local, "good food" to her clients who are looking to overcome diet and chronic health challenges. Her many travels and state residencies brought her right back to central Virginia, where family roots run deep. When she is not in the Ivy warehouse, she is hopping around the breweries and wineries of Nelson Co., training for half marathons, attending a Phish concert, or experimenting with recipes from Sally Fallon's <em>Nourishing Traditions</em>.</p>
