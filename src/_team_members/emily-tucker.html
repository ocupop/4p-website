            <p>Emily grew up in Saint Paul, MN, where she learned to enjoy and value great food and the great outdoors. She attended the University of Minnesota, where she majored in French and International Development.</p>
            <p>Wherever Emily happened to be, Emily found a way to immerse herself in the local food community &ndash; whether it was working on the student-run organic farm at the U of M, installing community gardens in Montpellier, France, or volunteering at a neighborhood grocery store in Washington, D.C.</p>
            <p>After a couple of years working in development for a nonprofit in Washington, Emily took stock of her favorite extracurriculars and identified the one common thread &ndash; food! When she&rsquo;s not getting the word out on our awesome veggies and farmers, Emily can be found cooking with friends, searching for the best wood-fired pizza in the DMV, and trying to grow vegetables on her back porch.</p>
