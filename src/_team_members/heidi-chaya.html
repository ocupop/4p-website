  It depends on the season â€“ asparagus in the spring, tomatoes in the summer,
  etc. But if she had to pick one? Arugula all the way!

            <p>Heidi Chaya joined 4P Foods as a social media and brand intern in fall 2019. She majored in English at Georgian Court University while working in food service and as a freelance writer for the hospitality industry. Studying ecocriticism and food studies literature led her to realize that the disconnection between people and nature can be addressed through food.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Ever since she was a child, Heidi has always been drawn to the intersection of food and adventure, exploring the diverse flavors of the Jersey Shore where she grew up and finding inspiration in her travels. Before moving to the Shenandoah Valley, she lived in Vermont, where she learned to fish, forage, and hunt while connecting with farmers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Heidi is an avid home cook and always looking for a new culinary challenge. She especially enjoys nose-to-tail recipes and anything involving fire and cast iron. Her internship with 4P has offered her many opportunities to apply her passion for food and her background in communications to the improvement of our food system &ndash; plus plenty of fresh produce to keep her busy in the kitchen!</p>
