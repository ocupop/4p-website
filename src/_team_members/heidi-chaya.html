            <p>Heidi Chaya initially joined 4P Foods as a social media and brand intern in fall 2019. She majored in English at Georgian Court University while working in food service and freelance writing. Studying ecocriticism and food studies literature led her to realize that the disconnection between people and nature can be addressed through food.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Ever since she was a child, Heidi has always been drawn to the intersection of food and adventure, exploring the diverse flavors of the Jersey Shore where she grew up and finding inspiration in her travels. Before moving to Shenandoah Valley, she lived in Vermont, where she learned to forage, hunt, and support sustainable agriculture.</p>
            <p>Heidi has farmhand experience and she's a novice gardener and avid home cook, always looking for a new culinary challenge. She especially enjoys nose-to-tail recipes and cooking outdoors. 4P Foods has offered her many opportunities to apply her passion for food and her background in communications to the improvement of our food system &ndash; plus plenty of farm-fresh ingredients to keep her busy in the kitchen!</p>
