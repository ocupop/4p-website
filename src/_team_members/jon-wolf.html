            <p>Jon lives in Madison, VA with his wife and kids. When he&rsquo;s not controlling the chaos that is aggregating, sorting, and delivering local food, you can find him on the soccer field coaching his kids' team. Jon is a huge Washington Nationals fan. Go Nats!</p>
            <p>Jon grew up on his family farm in Virginia. While Jon dabbled in raising chickens through the Joel-Salatin style chicken tractor, the hours spent cleaning the birds helped him to conclude it was not for him, and he now has a deep appreciation of the hard-work our pastured farmers do.</p>
