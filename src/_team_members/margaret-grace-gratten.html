            <p>Born and raised in Virginia, Grace has always loved food, plants, and cooking. Following a two- year sustainable farming fellowship after college she wanted to continue to make change within our food system and found her way to 4P Foods. In her free-time, Grace enjoys biking, listening to audiobooks and podcasts, and gardening (house plants and whatever will fit on her tiny patio!).</p>
