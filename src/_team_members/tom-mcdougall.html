  Kohlrabi.  Funky colors, great tap root, and a fun conversation starter. 
  Tastes great too.

            <p>Tom was born and raised in the mid-Hudson Valley region of New York. He grew to love the rolling country, and learned to question the exurban sprawl that took over one pasture after another around his childhood community. His backyard was once a 200 acre dairy operation. The land had to be sold off, and it’s now a golf course.</p>
            <p>After moving to Washington, DC 20 years ago, he volunteered with food access and food justice organizations, beginning to learn about our food system’s 400 year history of extraction and oppression, which has driven the inequitable social determinants of health we see today in communities across the country. After a career that sent Tom to China, where he saw and experienced what <em><strong>externalized costs</strong></em> truly look like in our global system - environmental and human costs that don’t show up in the price that is paid - Tom found himself becoming a “social and environmental activist, stuck inside an entrepreneur's body.”</p>
            <p>In 2014, Tom launched 4P Foods, a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission to build a more regional, regenerative, and equitable food system. When he’s not slinging carrots alongside his wonderful team from the warehouse in Virginia, Tom is a passionate advocate of Dad jokes, gardening, camping, and big ideas.</p>
