    <p>“Our students and staff have loved getting local items from 4P! We have
    been surprised by our student's willingness to try new items like asparagus
    and golden beets. By partnering with 4P we have been able to expand our
    local food offerings and educate our students on what products are available
    in their home state.”</p>
