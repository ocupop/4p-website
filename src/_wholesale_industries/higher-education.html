    <p>“Working with 4P Foods has greatly enhanced our dining program. By
    educating students, we've increased awareness about sustainable food
    choices. Local purchases help us reduce our carbon footprint and actively
    combat climate change. Sourcing fresher, local products not only improves
    taste but also supports local farmers. Ultimately, our partnership with 4P
    Foods positively impacts our community on multiple fronts.”</p>
