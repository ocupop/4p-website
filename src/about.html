          Our Mission
        </h2>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>4P Foods was founded in 2014 by Tom McDougall with the goal of building an equitable food system while connecting Good Food from sustainable and small farms to customers in the DC-area. We believe that Good Food&mdash;food that is traceable, nutritious, accessible, and produced in a system that empowers farmers and sustains the environment&mdash;should be the norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that vision a reality each and every day. Every bag of produce, meat, and dairy we deliver not only supports a network of small family farms and artisan producers in the region, but also advances our mission and growing food access initiatives in the communities we serve. 4P is a food hub and mission-based benefit corporation.</p>

          Our Story
        </h2>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>Growing from the idea of the CSA-model and as an alternative to the big box grocery stores, 4P Foods offered convenience, flexibility, affordable locally grown food through direct delivery of 4P Bags to homes, offices, and communities. 4P Foods has always worked to ensure that all members of the community have access to good food and to help small farmers to thrive by connecting them to the market.</p>
          <p>Every week, 4P Foods offers the convenience of food deliveries to residences, offices, and community pick-up sites in eco-friendly reusable insulated bags. Our flexible swap system makes it easy to customize what&rsquo;s in your bag(s) each week, and you can cancel, skip, or donate your bag(s) at any time to a local food bank or nonprofit partner, Local Food Hub. Going on vacation? No problem! Don&rsquo;t like broccoli? You&rsquo;ve got options! Need extra ingredients for a special meal you&rsquo;re planning? You can double up on what you need.</p>
          <p>Behind the scenes, 4P Foods connects our small-scale, sustainable producers to more customers than they could reach on their own, while connecting consumers to our versatile growing network of other food hubs. Our farm partners are good environmental stewards of the land, and where possible, regenerative farmers going beyond organic to rebuild the soil and health of the community. We support hundreds of farmers in the Mid-Atlantic region and beyond by handling the distribution, logistics, and marketing so that these dedicated growers can get back to the hard work of growing food. While there are many incredible local farmers in the Mid-Atlantic who we buy from year-round, we also source from small farmers in more temperate growing regions who uphold our shared values- care for the environment, laborers, and local community.</p>
          <p>At 4P, we are number one for local with our strong, dynamic relationships with local farm partners and direct connections to what's in season. We embrace a values based regional sourcing model, which allows us to support many farmers year-round, while also offering the abundance from farmers in warmer climates. Especially during the off-season and cold winter months, most eaters welcome Fair Trade Organic avocados and&nbsp;<a href="/posts/the-story-of-our-citrus/">Rio Star grapefruits</a>, in addition to piles of turnips and cold storage apples, all grown with our shared vision of Good Food.</p>
          <p>Our regional network enables small farmers to thrive <em>and</em> customers to know and feel good about where they spend their food dollars. In the food industry, where national and even international supply chains fraught with labor and environmental harm are commonplace, transparency and a sense of place are precious commodities.</p>
          <p>Our strong and dynamic producer relationships also allow us to offer robust variety year-round. We will always offer what&rsquo;s in season from local farmers, but if you get sick of potatoes and cabbage in the winter, we are also able to source from the abundance of farmers in warmer climes. This means you can enjoy berries earlier and tomatoes later and even have <a href="/posts/beyond-local/">warm weather crops</a> in the winter! Together we are building a transparently sourced, resilient regional food system to connect fresh, nutrient-dense food from local communities to those who need it.</p>
