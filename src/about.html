          Our Mission
        </h2>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>4P Foods was founded in 2014 with the goal of building an equitable food system while connecting Good Food from sustainable and small farms to customers in the DC-area.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>We believe that Good Food&mdash; food that is traceable, nutritious, accessible, and produced in a system that empowers farmers and sustains the environment&mdash; should be the norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that vision a reality each and every day.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Every purchase with 4P not only supports a network of small family farms and artisan producers in the region, but also advances our mission and growing food equity in the communities we serve.</p>

          Our Story
        </h2>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>Growing from the CSA model and as an alternative to big box grocery stores, 4P Foods is your year-round connection to healthy, fresh food grown on small to mid-sized family farms. 4P was founded by Tom McDougall as a mission-based food hub and has always worked to ensure that all members of the community have access to Good Food and to help small farmers flourish by connecting them to the market.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Our farm partners are good environmental stewards of the land, and where possible, regenerative farmers going beyond organic to rebuild the soil and health of the community. We connect farmers to market through deliveries to residences, offices, and community pick-up sites, plus our wholesale outlets. 4P Bags are packaged in eco-friendly insulated tote bags to curb our carbon footprint. Together with our community food access partners, we are able to help get nutrient-dense, healthy food into the hands of those who need it.&nbsp;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;Our mission is about more than just food&mdash;it&rsquo;s about making a lasting impact on our community, our economy, and our environment.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>At 4P, we are number one for local with our strong, dynamic relationships with local farm partners and direct connections to what's in season. We embrace a&nbsp;<a href="/posts/beyond-local/">regional</a> sourcing model, which allows us to support many farmers year-round, while also offering the abundance of Good Food from farmers in warmer climates. Especially during the off-season and cold winter months, most eaters welcome Fair Trade Organic avocados from farmer-owned cooperatives in Haiti and Rio Star grapefruits grown with sustainable methods on a minority-owned first generation family farm in Texas, in addition to piles of locally grown turnips and cold storage apples. Every 4P Bag helps small farmers to thrive <em>and</em> customers to know and feel good about where they spend their food dollars. Together we are building a transparently sourced, resilient regional food system to connect fresh, nutrient-dense food from local communities to those who need it.
