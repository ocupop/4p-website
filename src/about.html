          Our Mission
        </h2>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>We believe that Good Food&mdash; food that is traceable, nutritious, accessible, and produced in a system that empowers farmers and sustains the environment&mdash; should be the norm, not the exception, and we actively work to make that vision a reality each and every day. Every purchase with 4P not only supports a growing network of small family farms and artisan producers in the region, but also advances equitable access to fresh healthy food in the communities we serve.</p>

          Our Story
        </h2>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>4P Foods was founded in 2014 growing from the CSA model and as an alternative to conventional big box grocery store. In the early days, 4P Foods founder and CEO, Tom McDougall would ride the metro with bags of farm-fresh local produce to deliver to its first customers in the DC-area. Today our story has evolved to serve the greater DC, MD, VA region, thanks to the continued support of our loyal customers, our hardworking team, and generosity of our supporters. 4P Foods is a values-driven Good Food hub and benefit corporation that empowers sustainable farmers and builds a more equitable food system with every delivery.</p>
          <p>Every day, we work towards this goal of improving access to fresh, healthy food&nbsp; through our partnerships with independent family farms in the Mid-Atlantic region and our partnerships with non-profits and organizations in the communities we serve. As a Good Food hub, we connect fresh food from independent family farms to those who need it, whether through our direct doorstep delivery service, our local food pantry donation program, wholesale restaurants and markets, not to mention our collaborations and long-time partnerships with organizations that build food access and public health. Together we can empower sustainable and regenerative farmers while building a more equitable food system in the communities we serve. Learn more about our&nbsp;<a href="https://shenandoahproduce.4pfoods.com/our-partners">community partners</a>&nbsp;here.</p>
          <h2>Our Promise</h2>
          <p>Our farm partners are good environmental stewards of the land, the food, the animals, land, and communities they serve. We encourage farmers to work towards GAP and Organic Certifications, and promote sustainable and regenerative farming methods to rebuild the soil and health of the community. We pay farmers fair price for the work they do and support equitable food sourcing and fair labor practices for lasting economic impact. 4P Bags are packaged in eco-friendly insulated tote bags to curb our carbon footprint. We prioritize our local farmers and the Mid-Atlantic region, plus we will always strive to provide you with source transparency so that you can make informed decisions about what food is on your table.</p>
