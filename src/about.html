          our story
        </h2>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>4P Foods took root in 2014 with a lofty goal: to build a Good Food system that is a regenerative and equitable alternative to the industrial food system. Step one was adapting the CSA model to the age of online shopping and food delivery, and in the early days before 4P Foods had a delivery fleet, founder and CEO Tom McDougall rode the DC metro with bags of farm-fresh local produce to deliver to our first customers. Today 4P Foods has grown and blossomed, delivering thousands of bags each week across DC, Maryland, and Virginia to customers and community food access partners.&nbsp;</p>
