          <p>If you are reporting an issue with our website being slow please note that our IT team is working on it, and there are a few possible reasons why. We are going to give you all of our best suggestions :)</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Around 8pm Saturday night, we got our website admin to restart the server. The website should be running faster now.</li>
            <li>If you were having trouble with the customize button before, it may have been because the website was still loading all of the options (the produce share has more than the other shares). If it was before then, please try it again.</li>
            <li>Make sure it is showing the upcoming week and that you are not accidentally set a few weeks out!</li>
            <li>Lastly, if the customize button is still not working and you are on the correct week, you can try canceling the Produce share and adding it back - our IT person tested this out on some accounts that were still having this issue and it worked.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If none of these work or you have a different question, please go ahead and submit your question below.</p>
