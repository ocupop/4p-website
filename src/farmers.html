      and regional partners. We cultivate a network of growers and producers who
      engage in labor practices that enable people and communities to thrive,
      and in growing practices that actively build the soil and promote
      biodiversity. Year-round, you can get freshly harvested produce, dairy and
      meat products delivered directly from our trusted network of farms and
      artisans. Read about some of the amazing producers that make up our Good
