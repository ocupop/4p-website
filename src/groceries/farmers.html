    4P Foods sources fresh, high-quality, delicious food, prioritizing local and
    regional partners. We cultivate a network of growers and producers who
    engage in labor practices that enable people and communities to thrive, and
    in growing practices that actively build the soil and promote biodiversity.
    Year-round, you can get freshly harvested produce, dairy and meat products
    delivered directly from our trusted network of farms and artisans. Read
    about some of the amazing producers that make up our Good Food communityâ€”
    and make them your food community too!
