          <h4>Good Food FOR ALL</h4>
          <p>Our values go beyond local. At 4P, we focus on Good Food, which to us is food that 1) provides nourishment and enables people to thrive, 2) is equitably accessible to everyone in our region, 3) is produced in a manner that is environmentally regenerative, 4) comes from a supply chain in which every being is treated with respect and dignity, and 5) improves health outcomes and economic security for all.</p>
          <h4>support family farmers</h4>
          <p>As a food hub, we work with family farmers and artisans to pay fair prices for sustainably produced food. Farm partners are from a local and regional network of growers to connect you to high quality food that is ethically and transparently sourced year-round.</p>
          <h4>Committed to our planet</h4>
          <p>Together we're building a more sustainable food system that supports low-impact, sustainable, and regenerative methods of food production. Efficiently delivered in reusable packaging to improve our carbon footprint.</p>
