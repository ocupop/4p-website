          <h4>Direct from local farmers and makers</h4>
          <p>We're making it more easier to source in-season food direct from local farming communities. The closer your food source is - the longer it stays on the vine to ripen and soak in the nutrients. Eat seasonal and healthy food fresh and transparently sourced from our trusted network of regional farms.&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>Committed to our planet</h4>
          <p>Together we're building a more sustainable food system that supports low-impact, sustainable, and regenerative methods of food production. Curb your food footprint with responsibly produced groceries delivered in reusable packaging.</p>
          <h4>Good food for all</h4>
          <p>Our values go beyond local. With 4P Foods, your food dollars support small-scale farmers and help make Good Food--food that is nourishing, equitably accessible, environmentally regenerative, and ethically produced--available to all.</p>
