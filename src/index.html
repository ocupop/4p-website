      I choose 4P because they work with small growers and help farmers, plus I

      I love that I know what I'll be getting, can skip a week or donate. The
      veggies and fruit so far have been amazing and I love the recipes in the

      4P meets me halfway in that they provide a connection point between my
      store and a varied regional selection of products, a relief I am sure to
      busy farmers, and this with a personable and easy to work with staff. I
      highly recommend them.
