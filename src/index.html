      We've tried many meal prep kits and grocery delivery services - nothing

      I choose 4P because they work with small growers and help farmers, plus I
      love the fresh, diverse offerings and items.

      I love that I know what I'll be getting, can skip a week or donate. The
      veggies and fruit so far have been amazing and I love the recipes in the

      We ate well this year, and lost weight! Great for pandemic, but even
      better for long term shift of eating local in season.

      4P meets me halfway in that they provide a connection point between my
      store and a varied regional selection of products, a relief I am sure to
      busy farmers, and this with a personable and easy to work with staff. I
      highly recommend them.
