  - name: 'Local Food Hub: Fresh Farmacy Program'
    description: >-
      The Fresh Farmacy: Fruit and Veggie Prescription Program was established
      by Local Food Hub in 2015 to provide biweekly shares of  fruit and
      vegetables to those members of our community who have limited access to
      fresh fruits and vegetables and suffer from diet-related diseases such as
      hypertension and diabetes. Priority is placed on sourcing food from small
      family farms in Virginia, providing more than two dozen growers with an
      important sales outlet.. In addition to the bounty in each share,
      participants receive program support materials designed to build
      confidence in cooking and eating locally and seasonally, plus tips for
      safe storage and handling of produce at home. Local Food Hub is
      responsible for program development, management, and fundraising.


      In light of COVID-19, Local Food Hub expanded the Fresh Farmacy program to
      serve over twice as many people (650+) for a longer season, with weekly
      food deliveries rather than biweekly. To date in 2020, the program has
      distributed more than 87K pounds of produce, with close to $250K
      reinvested in the local economy. 

       4P Foods is responsible for product sourcing, as well as packing and delivering a portion of the shares.
