  - name: Bainum Family Foundation
    description: >-
      The Bainum Family Foundation Food Security Initiative supports the
      creation of a sustainable, end-to-end solution to the District’s broken
      food system that will better address the needs of low-income children and
      families in Wards 7 and 8. As a partner with 4P Foods, together we are
      establishing new pathways for local food into and within D.C. to benefit
      both the community and local farmers.

  - name: The YMCA of Metropolitan Washington
    description: >-
      The YMCA Food Programs promote health and community through cooking
      classes making food prep easy and stress-free for families because we
      believe in the power of a shared meal. The Y’s food programs adopt
      community-specific programming that addresses the needs and desires of our
      families. Through 4P’s partnership with the YMCA of Metropolitan
      Washington, we provide nutrient-dense fresh ingredients from our farm
      network for cooking classes.

      The Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy uses the sports of
      baseball and softball as vehicles to foster positive character
      development, academic achievement and improved health among youth from
      underserved communities in Washington, D.C. The Community Supported
      Agriculture (CSA) partnership is aimed at increasing access to organic
      foods in Wards 7 and 8 through a year-round CSA-style market filled with
      affordable, locally grown produce.

  - name: Local Food Hub
    description: >-
      Local Food Hub is a nonprofit organization that partners with Virginia
      farmers to increase community access to local food. Its Fresh Farmacy:
      Fruit and Veggie Prescription Program began in 2015 to provide shares of
      fresh produce to members of its community who have limited access to fresh
      fruits and vegetables and suffer from diet-related illnesses, such as
      hypertension or diabetes. Food is primarily sourced from small family
      farms in Virginia, providing more than two dozen growers with an important
      sales outlet. In addition to the bounty in each share, participants
      receive program support materials designed to build confidence in
      preparing and eating fresh produce, plus tips for safe storage and
      handling of produce at home. Local Food Hub is responsible for program
      development, management, and fundraising. Since its founding, the program
      has always been available for free to participants. 


      In response to COVID-19, Local Food Hub expanded the Fresh Farmacy program
      to serve over twice as many homes (650+) for a longer duration, with
      weekly food deliveries rather than biweekly. 4P Foods is responsible for
      product sourcing, as well as packing and delivering a portion of the
      shares.

    description: >-
      As part of our commitment to community sustainability and team member
      wellness, we are partnering with a local food hub to distribute weekly
      farm share boxes to our staff. Knowing that the food we all eat plays an
      integral role in the planet’s health and our personal health, Inova wants
      to support local, seasonal farmers, while at the same time making it
      easier for our team members to access their food.

      helps feed the hungry in Fauquier County, Virginia. Since our founding, 4P
      Foods has donated 1:10 bags that we deliver to a weekly food pantry to
      provide access to healthy, fresh food within the communities we serve.
