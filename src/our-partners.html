  - name: Bainum Family Foundation
    description: >-
      The Bainum Family Foundation Food Security Initiative supports the
      creation of a sustainable, end-to-end solution to the District’s broken
      food system that will better address the needs of low-income children and
      families in Wards 7 and 8. As a partner with 4P Foods, together we are
      establishing new pathways for local food into and within D.C. to benefit
      both the community and local farmers.

  - name: The YMCA of Metropolitan Washington
    description: >-
      The YMCA Food Programs promote health and community through cooking
      classes making food prep easy and stress-free for families because we
      believe in the power of a shared meal. The Y’s food programs adopt
      community-specific programming that addresses the needs and desires of our
      families. Through 4P’s partnership with the YMCA of Metropolitan
      Washington, we provide nutrient-dense fresh ingredients from our farm
      network for cooking classes.

      The Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy uses the sports of
      baseball and softball as vehicles to foster positive character
      development, academic achievement and improved health among youth from
      underserved communities in Washington, D.C. The Community Supported
      Agriculture (CSA) partnership is aimed at increasing access to organic
      foods in Wards 7 and 8 through a year-round CSA-style market filled with
      affordable, locally grown produce.

  - name: Local Food Hub
    description: >-
      The Fresh Farmacy: Fruit and Veggie Prescription Program was established
      by Local Food Hub in 2015 to provide biweekly shares of local fruit and
      vegetables to those members of our community who have limited access to
      fresh fruits and vegetables and suffer from diet-related diseases such as
      hypertension and diabetes. In addition to the bounty in each share,
      participants receive program support materials designed to build
      confidence in cooking and eating locally and seasonally, plus tips for
      safe storage and handling of produce at home. Local Food Hub is
      responsible for program development, management, and fundraising, while
      the shares are packed and delivered by 4P Foods.

  - name: INOVA Hospital
    description: >-
      As part of our commitment to community sustainability and team member
      wellness, we are partnering with a local food hub to distribute weekly
      farm share boxes to our staff. Knowing that the food we all eat plays an
      integral role in the planet’s health and our personal health, Inova wants
      to support local, seasonal farmers, while at the same time making it
      easier for our team members to access their food.
