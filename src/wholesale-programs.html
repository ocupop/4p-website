          <p>We know that local sourcing can be challenging for businesses, but consumers increasingly want to know where their food
          comes from and how it was grown. We are here to help. Our extensive product offerings include produce, meat, dairy,
          pantry, and value-added grocery items, all source-identified so you know exactly where they come from.</p>
          <p>We work with farmers and buyers to make the process as easy and successful as possible on both sides. If you are
          interested in seeing our availability list or would like to get in touch with someone on our team to learn more about
          how we could fill your needs, please click below to contact us.</p>
